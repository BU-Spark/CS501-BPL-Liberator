The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

All these losses, all these per-\nils, we trust, may yet be averted, and the present\nowners of the soil retain their property, and long di-\nrect the labors of the colored population by simply\ngranting them their inalienable rights. It is true,\nthe door must be opened for their gradual elevation\nof character and standing even to an equality with\nus, and every moment's delay is dangerous. Their\nrise, were all inpediments to be removed to-mor-\nrow, would of necessity be gradual, and the public\nmind would be gradually preparing for it.\nWhat can we say in palliation of our conduct ?\nNever had oppressors so little plea for their injustice\ntoward a people, patient beyond all former exam-\nple. Our cupidity, in recently permitting an exten-\nsive domestic slave trade, has scattered throughout\nthis class the seeds of intelligence, that we can nev-\ner eradicate. Examples are multiplying around us\nof the perfect safety of liberating slaves, and of the\ncertain ultimate consequences of continuing slavery.\nCan we hesitate in our choice?\nTrained as our victims have long been in the\nschool of sorrow and of suffering, their uncomplain-\ning firmness of character and a protecting Providence\nwill yet work their redemption ; and every effort\nwe may make to bind and to crush, will be like\nraising a dam across a stream, whose waters are\ncontinually accuvulating.\nWhile we are sinking ourselves by ceaseless ef-\nforts to traduce and expel them, they are rising in\nesteem and worth, and our children's children will\nblush for our conduct.\nMy views are now before you-it will require no\nfunds to carry them into effect. Some sacrifices of\nnominal and pretended property, and of unworthy\nprejudices, must indeed be made ; and let these be\nbalanced by the unspeakable advantages to be reap-\ned, and the unrequitable though just claims on the\nother side.

I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments?

And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

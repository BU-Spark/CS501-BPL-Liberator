This soon attracted a groupe tou\nof about one hundred and fifty persons, who the\nall seemed ripe for disorder and riot. After tho\ncreating sundry disturbances, they proceed-Jel\ned to send stones and brick-bats at severalgin\nof the adjacent houses. They attacked the sys\nunoccupied apartments of the building No. cau\n22, Canal street, the under part of which was\noccupied by Mr. E. T. Robb as a Mahogany inte\nyard and store, and broke in the windows, ed\nthen broke in the window sashes and glass nal\nin the windows of the second story of the of\nhouse No.18 Canal street, occupied by Hugh\nSheffington, and drove his wife and five small of\nchildren from their beds, to seek shelter else- wo\nwhere; split the sign and battered the doors the\nof Mr. John Kasay, No. 10, and next to the the\nGas House, as also some of the windows in nea\nthe shop of Thomas Shepherd, coach-maker, ma\nNo. 2, Canal-street. The watch rushed in int\namong them, but were at first unable to re-we\npress the dirorder, and one of the watchmen to\nand a citizen were violently assaulted and ma\nbeaten by the ruthless invaders of the public\npeace.\ntle\nThe rioters appeared to have no definite Im\nobject, but indulged in wanton mischief, ap- tur\nparently for the mere love of it. They dis-low\npersed about three o'clock in the morning.- for\nN. Y. Daily Advertiser.\nTI\nRior. The Columbia (Lancaster county, So\nPa.) Spy gives the following account of riots tio\nin that borough: 'On Saturday, Sunday and\nMonday evening last, the first outbreakings ac\nof a riotous disposition were exhibited, and a\nthe windows of the houses of several of the\ncolored people were broken,partly on account\nab\nof their own imprudence, and partly through ar\nthe prevaleat spirit of jealousy and animos- tie\nity which pervades the country respecting te\nthat class of the population. On Tuesday\nnight, however, the disorder broke out more la\nviolently, the passions of the persons who ble\ntook part in the mob, and who generally pr\nconsisted of mirrors, with some older but not lig\nmore reflecting heads among them, having ca\nbeen fired by a disturbance in the early part ar\nof the evening, represented by some as an of\nattack by the blacks on a white man going\nto watch a lot on the outskirts of the town, dr\nand by others as a defence of their property te\nwhen assailed by violence. A band of per- sa\nsons consisting in all of not more than fifty, fo\nthen collected and marched to that part of fil\nthe borough generally occupied by the col- tu\nored population, attacked and injured a num-de\nber of the houses with stones, disturbed the\npl\nquiet of the place by shouting, and fired off th\nguns occasionally, though without any se-\nrious result. The mob dispersed early, and\nthe citizens on Wednesday assembled in til\ntown meeting, and made some additions to ly\nthe Police; and pledged themselves to sus-\ntain the peace of the city.'\n[From the Rochester \u00b7 Rights of Man.']\nSELF-PIRACY !!!\nh\nA few days since a colored woman arrived\nt.\nhere on board of one of the canal packet A\nboats; she was immediately arrested under\na warrant, issued at Palmyra, on charge of\nStealing. A cheat was suspected. A mob-\nbish looking collection of persons, composed\nof black and white, soon assembled-de-\nmanded of the officer his authority, and\nmanifested some determination not to let\nh\nhim proceed till they were satisfied. The\nMayor was sent for, who examined the pre-\nh\ncept and pronounced it legal so far as he\ncould judge, and requested the crowd to\ndisperse peaceably. What has she stolen?\nWhat has she stolen! why--hem-baw---\nshe has stolen herself ; SHE IS A RUNAWAY\nWhat a horrible sin! And this is\nthe proof that slaveholders would abolish\nslavery if they could, but would not manumit\na slave on any condition, and if he steals\nhimself, would pursue him to the ends of the\nearth, at any expense. This is the abstract\nf\nabolishment of abstract slavery. What ab-\nstract, nay, what practical nonsense!\nE\ni\nDECEPTION-RIOTS, &c. &c.\nWhen the woman above mentioned was\ncarried to Palmyra, several colored men\nfollowed, determined, as we learn, that she\nshould have a fair trial. But, as was sus-\npected, it was all a farce. No trial was in-\nstituted, and she was locked up by her mis-\ntress-her master being absent. (We won-\nder on whose oath the warrant was issued\non charge of stealing, and if such oath were\nnot downright perjury ?)\nt\nThe colored men returned. But some two\nor three nights after, a greater number ral-\nlied from this and other places-assailed the\nhouse where this woman was kept; and re-\nport is--we have not, and cannot yet obtain\nauthentic particulars--that several guns were\nfired, and one colored man wounded in the\nface. The charge seems to have been only\nsmall shot. Several of the rioters on Wed-\nnesday the 13th inst. were apprehended and\ncarried in irons to Palmyra, to undergo a le-\ngal examination.]\nAll this is wrong, utterly wrong, and is as\nmuch deprecated by us as by any. But we\nmust bear the blame. It is all the work of\nAbolitionists! Our opponents with brazen\nface and triumphant tongue, will almost\ndeafen the public ear, with their shouts-\n'these are the effects of your Abolition doc-\ntrines.' It will never occur to them that\nSlavery is the cause; that if Slavery were\nabolished, no slaves would run away--com-\nmit self-piracy-no hot pursuits by slave-\nholders--no perjuries to obtain warrants-\nno indignation and riots among the colored\npeople, would occur.

This is the cheering promise of Him who be\ntouched Isaial\u0131's hallowed lips with fire.' 'This is Ma\nthe consequence of immediate emancipation--CO\nthorough, cordial emancipation,-as portrayed by be\nJehovah of hosts, who sees the end from the be-\nan\nginning. Why should it not be so? Slavery is a ple\nsystem of darkness and wo: hence its removal must\ncause light and joy to succeed it.\nThe British West India Islands are now the most\ninteresting portion of the globe. All eyes are turn-\nni\ned upon them to witness the effects of the most sig-\nnal instance of emancipation recorded on the page co\npe\nof history.\nsh\nIt is not much over two years since the Assembly\nof Jamaica adopted a resolution, 20 to 6, that it\nwould not entertain any measure tending to meliorate\nce\nthe condition of the negroes?!!-An insurrection\n\u0410\nthen broke out among the despairing slaves, in which\nnearly THREE THOUSAND of their number, and\npe\nmany whites, were killed--the missionaries were cast\ntic\ninto prison, and tried for sedition-their chapels\nwere razed to the ground-and they were compelled It\nto seek safety in flight. This insurrection cost Ja-\nho\nmaica one million of dollars.\nA year ago, the Parliament of Great Britain set:\ntled the question of emancipation in the Colonies.\nfu\nImmediately, the exiled missionaries began to re-\nturn, carrying with them the gospel of peace and\nis\nlove. One year of hard bondage was still reserved\nfor the slaves, but freedom was to follow at its ex-\nfr\npiration, and they became tractable and obedient.\nThe committee of the British and Foreign Bible\nOL\nSociety, June 2, 1834, adopted the following resolu-\ntion:\nResolved, That a copy of the New Testament,\naccompanied by the book of Psalms in a large type\nand substantially bound, be tendered to every per-\nth\nson receiving the gift of freedom on the approach to\ning 1st of August, who can read, or who, though not\nable to read, is the head of a family in which there\nare readers, or children learning to read; such par-\nth\nties receiving a recommendation from a minister,\nteacher or employer.\nh:\nMore recently, a scheme has been devised in Eng-ca\nland, for raising the sum of \u00a320,000, so that the Bi-li\nble and religious and secular instruction may be\nke\npromptly given to the emancipated slaves. Thus, al\nlight is rising in obscurity, and the darkness is best\ncoming as the noon-day. Some trust in chariots,\ntl\nand some in horses; but we will remember the name\nal of the Lord our God.'\nOn the first day of the present month, eight hun-\nh:\ndred thousand slaves were redeemed from their \u017fet-\nters, at a blow,by the irresistible Genius of Univer-\n- sal Emancipation. The following is the latest in-\nformation from the colonies, and it is calculated to\nf fill the breast of every lover of freedom with grati-\ntude and thanksgiving. The conduct of these re-se\n- deemed captives deserves the admiration and ap-th\ne plause of the world, and covers with shame alike\nf the slanderers of the colored race, and the alarmists in\nwho have gravely predicted that blood, and arson, T\nand pillage, would follow in the train of emancipa-\ntion. Volumes of comment might here be pertinent-d\nly made, but we leave our readers to indulge their T\nown reflections.\nb\n[From the New York Journal of Commerce.] b\nFROM BERMUDA. By the schr. Jane, we a\nhave received Bermuda Royal Gazettes to re\nthe 12th inst. inclusive. The Emancipation b\nt Act went into operation on the 1st inst. m\nr. Says the Royal Gazette of the 5th,\nf\nThe rubicon is passed, the step from Sla-\nti\nd\nvery to Freedom has been taken, a step\nwhich for confidence and honest boldness\nte\nd. stands unequalled in the Annals of the World;\n--and we sincerely trust that the movement\nhas been effected with the same ease and\nf\n\u0435\nsecurity in the other British Colonies that its\nhas been in this. For then this act of liber-\n\u0435\nality and humanity will, as it must, peculiarly\nto\n2 distinguish the reign of our beloved Monarch\nWilliam the Fourth--even though his pe-\nriod of Sovereignty was unmarked by any\nf\nY\nother of those memorable events for which\ns\nh\nit is so justly esteemed.\nThe eventful first day of August 1834, a\nit\nperiod looked for in all the British West In-\n's\ndia Colonies with the excited feelings of\n\u0435\nhope and fear;-hope by those in bondage P\nfor a relief from thraldom; fear, on the part\nof the owners lest that liberty which was to\nh\nbecome general would be the means of lead-\ning the newly emancipated, to acts unbe-\ncoming Men and Christians. The Month!\nLS\npreceding passed as its precursors, without,\n1\nn\nas might have been anticipated, any prepa-\ne\nrations being made to celebrate so grand an\nera. The first of August came, a day on\n]-\nwhich in this Island alone, near four thousand\nbeings received their freedom from a domes-\ntic slavery which had been perpetual. The\ned\nchange was gradual, was peaceable; and\n\u0441\u0435\nnone but those conscious of the work which\nthe lapse of a few hours, nay moments, was\no effecting, and familiar with the habits of the\n1-\npeople, could fancy such an event was taking\nae\nplace. The day was as remarkable for qui-\ne-\nin\netude, exemption from labor, and solemnity,\nas that which marks the Sabbath in every\nre\nChristian land. The only bustle perceptible\nne\nwas in the preparation for attending Public\nly\nworship, which His Excellency the Govern-\nd-\nor most wisely ordered to be performed-\nnd\nthereby dedicating it wholly to God, the\nwiller and the doer of this great work. The\nChurches and other places of public worship\nthroughout the Island were crowded to ex-\ncess-every possible accommodation being\nof\nafforded to the colored people. From every\nquarter we hear of their orderly, nay. more,\nst\ntheir exemplary behaviour; for those assem-\nbled in the Parish Church of Pembroke-\nupwards we think of four hundred-we say\nnat\nwith much satisfaction that in the many\nere churches and chapels and other places of\nm.\nworship, of various denominations of Chris-\ne-\ntians which we have visited, we have never\nseen a more orderly, a more becoming or a\ned\nmore attentive congregation. The solemn\nC00\noccasion on which they were asseinbled, had\non\nevidently wrought much on their minds; and\nthe affectionate, good and wholesome advice\nof their Pastor will it is hoped have a proper\nnd\nand lasting effect.\nU-\nFour days of universal Freedom have now\npassed; and four days of more perfect order,\ned regularity and quiet, have these famed\nes, peaceful Isles never witnessed; the opinion\nht. which this change would cause in the Slaves\nan- of this Island, long since expressed when\nnts even the Anti-Slavery Society was in its in-\nche fancy, by a person then and now high in\noth office in this Colony, has been to the letter\n\"he realized. In one instance only have we\nach heard of any thing like a general and public\nig- ebullition of feeling, and this consisted in\n-di-those recently liberated in St. George, meet-\ning on the square in that town, on Saturday\nhas morning, and giving three long and loud\nto huzzas, and then dispersing, each to his re-\nto spective home and occupation.\nIt must have been a gladsome, a heartfelt\nr\n\u0441\nEt\nS\nf\nV\n\u0441\nt\na\nr\n(\ne-\nas\nve\nen\nC- mer\nwa\n>\nha\nar\ne\ns\nPI\nWI\nth\n\u0441\u043e\nca\n\u0441\u043e\nJsight to all slave-owners, to witness the de-robb\nvout and reverential mien of their late de- goo\npendants in the House of God\u2014and their Let\nsteady and orderly conduct since; to feel to t\nthat the instruction which they had diligent- ural\nly extended to them, had so well fitted them\nto receive the great boon of Freedom which Con\ncircumstances have enabled them to grant To\nat so early a period.\nThus has commenced this wonderful\nchange; and it is expected from a people infli\nwho have shown so much discretion on the the\noccasion, that a similar line of conduct will\nbe pursued by them-as a reward to their\nMasters who have given up a part of the Me\ncompensation, by extending to them all the\nbenefits which they could possibly confer\ntion\nander the Imperial Act, so well as an exam-\narti\nple to the West India Colonies.\ning\n[From the same, August 12.]\ninc\nThe Legislature of Barbadoes, in common Lil\nwith several other of the West India Colo- the\nnies, have memorialized His Majesty, for my\npermission to distribute such portion of the bed\nCompensation Money as may fall to their of\nshare, on the per canita principle; this being am\nthe only just and correct mode, they con- tho\nceive, by which a division can be made.\nLittle on the probable effect of the 1st of ter\nAugust change is said in the Barbadoes pa- Iw\npers; we therefore infer that no interruption the\nto the general peace of the Island was an-ass\nticipated. Some circumstances have givency\ncause to apprehend disturbances at Grenada. oth\nIt is confidentiy expected, however, that the of\nhorrors of 1795, carefully instilled into the ou\nminds of the young slaves, by those who sta\nwere witnesses and sufferers of that event- it.\nful period, in that Island's history, will pre-wit\nvent any thing like an insurrection. Every ed\nisland in the West Indies is now strongly go\ngarrisoned, and the facility of removing troops col\nfrom one to the other, by means of men-of-the\nwar,will tend much to preserve order through- ch\nout the British Western Archipelago. be\nwi\nHAMILTON, (Bermuda,) Aug. 12. yo\nThe Brilliant will sail for New-York on\nw!\nthe 19th inst.

Let them ponder\ntheir tremendous responsibility. Let them retrace\nny the experience of the last six weeks. The Mayor of\nof New-York, instead of putting down the vile and\nis- filthy dregs which were let loose like satyrs in high\ner and holy places, suggested excuses for their contin-\nra uing, and reached to them weapons and firebrands.\nnn And what is the result? 'The guilt in which the\nad mayor and many of the aristocracy, the wealth and\nnd the public press of New-York were the most deeply\nice implicated, could not be punished with condign pan-\nberishment. What, then, has been done? A poor,\npitiable vagabond, a miserable bit of squalidity, has\now been sent to Blackwell's Island for six months or a\ner, year! This is noble. This does honor to a land\ned of liberty and LAW. This mitigates the remorse\nion which the guilty instigators and encouragers of\nves) those poor, ignorant and starving creatures are not\nnen too hardened to feel.\nin- The consequence of the toleration and impunity of\nin the horrible atrocities at New-York, has been the\nter emulous imitation of them elsewhere. We do un-\nwe hesitatingly pronounce that the conduct of the press-\nlices and the mayor of New-York is the proximate\nin cause of the Charlestown and Philadelphia mobs.\net- It is true that much of the soi-disant respectability\nlay and would-be aristocraey (the real hearty lovers of\nud despotism and slavery in the abstract') countenanc-\nre-ed the canaille in each case.

WM. L. GARRISON:\nDear Sir-The object of this communica-\ntion is to express to you my regret, that any\narticle should appear in your paper, contain-\ning a statement, which appears to me to be\nincorrect. The article aluded to, is in the\nLiberator of the 2d inst. in which you charge\nthe Rev. Messrs. Breckinridge with blasphe-\nmy. I was grieved to see this charge, not\nbecause I am a Colonization man, or a friend\nof the Colonization Society; but because I\nam an Anti-Slavery man, and a friend of\nthose who advocate the principles of the\nAnti-Slavery Society, and feel a strong in-\nterest, in every thing that affects that cause.\nI was sorry to see this charge, because I\nthought that it could not be proved; (1) and\nassertions of this kind have a strong tenden-\ncy to alienate the minds of many, who would\notherwise be our friends; besides, the charge\nof blasphemy is a very serious charge, and\nought not to be made without the most sub-\nstantial and conclusive evidence to sustain\nit. (2) I was also sorry to see them charged\nwith being 'frantic persecutors of the color-\ned race. Is it not possible that they may be\ngoverned by the kindest feelings towards our\ncolored brethren? (3) They are ministers of\nthe gospel, and possess the confidence of the\nchurches, and ought not their statement to\nbe respected, until they are proved to be\nwilful fabrications? (4) For the benefit of\nyour readers, I hope that you will show\nwherein the speeches of the gentlemen re-\nferred to were truly ferocious and essen-\ntially diabolical,' and wherein contradiction,\nslander, deceitfulness, oppression and blas-\nphemy\u2019abounded; and also show that you\nwas just in saying that their speeches would\nhave disgraced barbarians.' (5) Sir, I know\nof many who can find no other cause of op-\nposition to our Society, except that we some-\ntimes make some unguarded attacks on the\ncharacter of good men; and make some\nstatements, as they think, without sufficient\ngrounds. I think that this is an evil in our\nSociety: can it not be remedied? (6)\nIn conclusion, I would congratulate you\non the success of the cause in which you are\nengaged, notwithstanding all the obstacles,\nfrom within and without; and in the language\nof Scripture I would say, 'Fear not, worm\nJacob, and ye men of Israel ; saith the Lord.\nBehold, I will make thee a new sharp thresh-\neing instrument having teeth: thou shalt\nthresh the mountains, and beat them small,\nand shalt make the hills as chaff.'\nS.

The first expense (can it not be met ?) wil\nbe the only one. The negroes shall do the rest, by\nextra work before day in the morning, and after\nnight in the evening; and if he shall manage them\nas prudently as 'the noble man' whose praise the\nhosts of heaven are waiting to sing, the southern\nChurch may be enabled, in sixteen years, 'to go to\nVirginia or Carolina, and purchase a gang of people\nof nearly double the number.' Largesse, largesse\nChristians all, for the pet child of the Spirit of Mis\nsions--THE MCDONOGHI INSTITUTE! If we may\nbe allowed to suggest a text for the sermons to be\npreached by our clergy, when this collection shal\nbe made in their parishes, and the advantages to ac\ncrue to the Church from slaves purchased and\nworked by the bishops of the South are held up to\nthe view of their congregations, we would name, as\npeculiarly appropriate, the fourth and fifth verses o\nthe eleventh chapter of Zechariah: Thus saith the\nLord my God, Feed the flock of the slaughtered\nwhose possessors slay them, and hold themselves no\nguilty ; AND THEY THAT SELL THEM SAY, BLESSED\nBE THE LORD, For I AM RICH, AND THEIR SHEP\nHERDS PITY THEM NOT. Should it be thought ad\nvisable, as it doubtless will be, to celebrate the\nopening of \"The McDonO'GH INSTITUTE' with a\ndiscourse from the pulpit, on the blessings it is to\ncall down upon the heads of the founders, there i\na verse of holy writ so clear and explicit, that the\npreacher may speak with perfect confidence on this\npoint. The great Head of the Church has already\nspoken and said: 'Woe unto him that buildeth his\nhouse with unrighteousness, and his chambers wit\nwrong; THAT USETH HIS NEIGHBOR'S SERVICE\nWITHOUT WAGES, AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS\nWORK! If the reverend editor of the Spirit of Mis\nsions should fill the pulpit on this occasion, he will\nof course, attempt to prove, as he now asserts, tha\nno wages ought to be paid, as the masters canno\nafford it.\nA proposition more monstrous than that of the\nSpirit of Missions, we venture to believe, was never\nmade to the American Church. A cool, deliberate\nproposition to Churchmen, to speculate in the bones\nand muscles af their brethren, to make the Church a\ntrafficker in 'slaves and the souls of men.' When\nthe whole world is ringing with denunciations of\nslavery, and the voice of philanthropy is echoed\nfrom the kingdoms of Europe to their colonies of the\nsea: from the northermost parts of Asia to the land\nof Cortez and the republics of the South : from the\nAutocracy of Russia to the Beylic of Tunis, de-\nmanding the liberation of the captive, and justice\nfor the slave, the appointed organ of the Episcopal\nChurch dares to stand forth, the open apologist and\ndefender of that dark system of oppression-to de-\nclare that Christian prudence' demands its contin-\nuance, and to propose that the Churchmen of Amer-\nica contribute to endow a mission school with hti-\nman chattels. What disciple of Machiavelli, whose\nbrazen sophistry puts Jesuitism to the blush, has\ncrept into the Church and assumed the editorial\nchair of its Mission organ, striving to degrade it be-\nfore the world--to gain for it the hiss of scorn, the\nfinger of contempt, and the jeer of the infidel?\n* Aha! aha! art thou become as one of us.' If we\nhad been admitted to orders in the Episcopal Church,\nto preach the truth as it is in Jesus, and had after--\nwards persuaded ourselves that it was expedient to\noppress our brother, if his skin were black, we could\nnot add hypocrisy to unbelief, by continuing to stand\nin the holy place, with the word of God upon our\nlips and a lie within our heart. Were we consis-\ntent, we would doff the robes of our priesthood, and\ndon the mantle of infidelity; or were we honest-\ndid we know the plague-spot within our breast, like\nthe leper, we would bare our head, and rend our\nclothes, and put a covering upon our lip, and warn\nevery Christian from approaching us crying, \"un-\nclean! unclean!!! We would persuade ourselves,\nif possible, that Revelation was a fiction, and Truth\na lie; that the immortality of the soul was but an\nillusion, and future responsibility, a bug-bear of the\nimagination, and then, with a quiet conscience,\ncould we join hands with the advocate of slavery,\nand clasp the slave-trader as a brother, for we could\nassure them, that self was the proper god for our\nidolatry, that expediency was the true rule of action,\nand that our life was but a span, with no eternity to\nfollow. Ay! we too, could we so harden our heart,\nmight trample, like this reverend editor, upon our\nbrother's rights, and treat with scorn, oppression and\ncontempt, the humble brethren of the Redeemer, if\nwe believed no God of justice reigned above, that\nwe might boldly demand, who art thou Lord ?'\nwithout receiving the awful answer, 'I am Jesus\nwhom thou persecutest.'\nThe editor, in a passage quoted by us, expressed\nhis feelings on reading the letter of Mr. McDonogh\n-we will be equally frank and assure him, that to\nsay we have read his comments upon that letter,\nwith deep sorrow, burning indignation, and sicken-\ning disgust, but faintly expresses our feelings. We\ntrust that they will raise such a storm of righteous\nanger among all true Churchmen, as we see by arti-\ncles in the Chronicle and Record,' the New-York\nAmerican,' and 'the Episcopal Recorder, they have\nalready begun to do, that the Board of Missions will\nfully apologize for the infamous doctrines of their\nsubordinate, and as soon as possible remove from a\nsituation he has disgraced, one who has trampled\nupon the holiest principles of the Church, tarnished\nher fair fame throughout the world, and endangered\nthe peace of her members by casting among them\nthe fire-brand of slavery.\nAnd this is the man who pretends to sneer at the\nphilanthropy of a Channing-to compare with his\npure and disinterested benevolence, the pecuniary\nprudence of a slave-dealer. This is the inan who\nmerely intimates that Channing's benevolence was\nheightened by aspirations after a niche in the tem-\nple of Fame, though he well knew that it was when\nthe storm of prejudice howled the loudest, and the\ncry of amalgamation against all who had a heart to\nfeel for the slave was borne upon every brseze, and\nloudly echoed from the pulpits of our land, that\nChanning, counting but as dust in the balance the\npopularity of which he was the idol, and the warm\napproval of endeared friends, manfully attacked the\nmonster slavery, which southern mammou so fondly\ncherishes, and the southern Church so carefully\nguards.\nWhile we lament the errors of Channing's faith,\nhis principles of action were infinitely more ortho-\ndox than those of this man, who, in the name of the\nChurch, unblushingly proclaims to the slaveholders, that they ought not to emancipate their slaves, be-\ncause they cannot afford it!!! On another page he\ndeclares, that the gift of Chtistianity to the slaves\nis an ample recompense for their captivity.' Let him\ngo himself into bondage as a chattel of the mission\nschool, and be repaid by their instruction, for he is\nnot initiated, as yet, into the first rudiments of Chris-\ntianity; and with this advice we hasten to dismiss\nso revolting a subject.\nWe have disclosed fects, which the welfare of ou\nChurch requires should be known, and at which, in\nthe language of Job, upright men shall be aston-\nished.'\nThe establishment of a system of CASTE which,\ntrampling principles under foot, and setting consti-\ntutions at defiance, debars candidates for orders from\nthe Seminary, and excludes clergymen and theit\nparishes from seats in the convention, and continues\nto treat with ignominy the lifeless remains when the\nspirit has returned to the God who gave it, is not on-\nly revolting to every christian feeling, but is start-\nling to those who remember that usurped power\nswells like an avalanche.'* Let the rule be once\nadopted in the Church, sic volo, sic jubeo-stat\nproratione voluntas,'t and we may discard, as useless\nlumber, her Articles and her Canons. The general\ncrouching of our bishops and clergy to popular pre-\njudice, with, indeed, noble exceptions--their fre-\nquent disregard in practice of the golden rules they\nteach, and their withholding of all aid from the phi-\nlanthrohic efforts of the age, will lead many to fear,\nand with justice, that the Church is lagging behind\nprevented by the fears of her ministers from per-\nforming her appropriate work. Such remissness, in\nthe cause of humanity, will lessen the love of her\nchildren, the respect of the world, and the confidence\nof all Christians who may feel and say,\nNon tali auxilio\nNec defensoribus istis tempus eget.'\nMore than seven centuries age, in the year 1102\nin the canons of a council held at London, it was\nsaid, 'Let no man, from henceforth, presume to car\nry on that wicked trafic by which men in England\nhave been hitherto sold like brute animals.?And\nthe organ of the Episcopal Church now declares,\nthat the traffic ought not to cease, because the mas-\nters cannot afford it, and bishops sat the example of\nbecoming slave-traders. We are forcibly reminded\nof Cameades, a Cyrenian philosepher, who was sent\nby the Athenians as embasssdor to Rome, and there\nargued before the niagistrates and people with great\npower and eloquenee in praise of justice. The next\nday, to establish his doctrine of the uncertainty of\nall human knowledge, he undertook to refute his\nformer arguments and prove them false; whereupon\nthe Senate, fearing that he would corrupt the morals\nof the nation, sent him home. Our pro-slavery cler-\ngy would seem to belong to the school of this phi-\nlosopher, but they have carried his doctrines to an\nextent never dreamed of by their founder. By main-\ntaining, at the same time, Christianity and slavery\nthey would show, if it were possible, not the uncer\ntainty of human knowledge, but the baseless chame-\nlion-like character of divine truth and eternal prin-\nciple. The time has been when we were liable to\nbe duced into vice by infidels and atheists, but\nnow it is the gowned priest and the mitred bishop\nwho teach us by their precept and their example, to\nenslave our brethren upon christian principles, and\nact the tyrant in the name of God.\nSince this article has been ready for the press-\nthe April number of the Spirit of Missions has been\npublished, in which it was fully expected the Mis\nsion Committee would disavow the infamous propo-\nsal of the editor, that the Church should become a\nspeculator in human flesh. Not one word upon the\nsubject do we find. The Board of Missions, through\ntheir committees, have adopted it as their own-\n*The CHURCH,' as represented by the Board of Mis-\nsions, approves the plan. May God pardon those\nwho so misrepresent her!

By this last act,\nNew-York acknowledged the constitutional ebligation\nto deliver up to their masters all fugitives from labor,\nas soon as they were proved to be such. But this did\nnot suit the views of certain negro-catchers, who\nvery well knew that they could not prove to a jury\nthat free colored citizens of this State were slaves.\nVirginia, in the same year, demanded of Gov.\nSeward the delivering up, as felons, of three color-\ned citizens of New York, who had assisted a slave\nto escape, and who were falsely charged upon oath\nwith having stolen hin The Governor very proper-\nly refused to surrender the men, as the charge was\nevidently a palpable lie, and then the Ancient Do-\nminion' thought it not derogatory to her dignity, to\npass an act subjecting all vessels from New-York\nto inspection, on the ground that every ship-captain\nwas a thief, and, unless narrowly watched, would\nsteal slaves; and the costs of this examination was\nall charged to the New-Yorkers; thus affording an\nopportunity for creating new and lucrative offices\nfor political partisans at our expense.\nvided by this act, that it should become null and\nvoid, as soon as New-York should give up the three\ninnocent sailors to vengeance, and also repeal the\njury law.\nThe light in which this outrageous law was re-\ngarded by many in Virginia, may be seen by a pas-\nsage from the Richmond Whig of February 17.-\nWe thought, and have frequently expressed the\nopinion, that the action of Virginia was, if not un-\nconstitutional, undignified, and unworthy of the\nCommonwealth. One might have supposed that\ninsult thus added to insult, would have aroused\nsome little particle of indignation in the democratic\nlegislators of our State; but their patience and hu-\nmility almost equal those of Job. The present\nGovernor, in his message, recommended the repeal\nof the jury law; and a majority of the committee, to\nwhom it was referred, made, in February, a report\nin accordance with his wishes, but so thoroughly\nservile, that even their own party were ashamed to\nacknowledge it, and referred it back to them. They\nhave since modified it, and the report has been again\ndiluted and emasculated, but still the same. We\nsuppose it is all right. Servility is the order of the\nday.

P. Pea-\nbody and G. E. Ellis. The article on slavery is an\nearnest and powerful production. It dissects the\nabominable foolishness of a writer in the Southern\nReview,' who endeavors, not to apologize for the\nperpetuation of the patriarchal institution, but to\nlegitiinize it as a divine ordination, against which\nwe should not, and against which we cannot virtu-\nously contend! He maintains that the Canaanites\nwere doomed perpetually to be a servile race --\nhewers of wood and drawers of water; the modern\nAfricans, he tells us, are the descendants of the Ca-\nnaanites, and heirs of the curse ; and to this it is\nadded, that the Creator has constituted them, boriy\nand soul, to be such; in support of which opinion,\nthe anatomist and psycologist are appealed to. The\nargument is briefly thus:-Noah's curse on Ham\nwas prophetical and perpetual ; the present negro\nraces are identically the same as the Canaanites;\nthe negro is, from necessity, more under the influ-\nence of his instincts, appetites, and animality, and\nless under the influence of his reflective faculties,\nthan other races of men; the negro's eye has an an-\natomical contrivance, by which a membranous wing\ncovers a considerable portion of the globe of the\neye, when he is exposed, as he must be, to the hot\nsun; in the negro's nature is provided a principle of\nprotection aguinst the exactions of a hard master, by\nmaking it impossible to force from him more than a\nmoderate amount of service ! --and next we are as-\nsured that the slaves are entirely contented with\ntheir condition, and have no desire for freedom.-\nThe review of this presumptuous and impious arti-\ncle, is one of the most earnest and right down sen-\nsible articles on the subject of southern slavery we\nhave ever read.

Some part of the lette\nto the Doctor seems, however, to be rather gratuitous\nparticularly that part which entrenches piracy be\nhind the patriarchs and Jehovah, Jesus and Paul\nfor it appears that the Doctor does not mean to med\ndle with the morality of the subject, but to confin\nhis observations to the mere animal. I cannot bu\nnotice that an indignity is offered to the gentleman?\nunderstanding, in several parts of your letter of Jan\n7th, but I apprehend no such thing was intended\nand if perceived by him, will not be noticed till th\nbook appears.\nI apprehend, my dear Sir, that you labor under\nslight misapprehension in some of the ideas expres\nsed in the above letter, for you say, that you can\nprove your slave system, to any unprejudiced mind\ntruly patriarchal, &c.-If so, it has improved im\nmensely since the abolition movement commenced\nfor before that time, it was TRULY DIABOLICAL; and\nI rejoice that the efforts of these true friends of bot\nmaster and slave have tended so greatly to amelior\nate the condition of the latter, and to harmonize the\nformer. But I cannot avoid believing it to be ne\ncessary that a mind should be quite prejudiced in fa\nvor of the system of oppression, to be susceptible o\nany such proof, although it may be that the defini\ntion of such words as prejudice, piracy, robbery, and\nsome others, vary, like the climate, according to lat\nitude and longitude; and this, I am aware, is the\ncase with regard to apparently some very plain and\nsimple language; for, in your reference to the case\nof Onesimus, which has been misquoted by the ad\nvocates of slavery all over Christendom, please to\nnotice, first, that if Onesimus was a chattel, he was\nnot sent back as such; for the apostle says of him\nWhom I have sent again.' How? As a chattel\nNo. As a slave? No. As property? No. Non\nas a servant, not as a SLAVE. How then? As\nBROTHER beloved,' as an EQUAL, as my own\nself.? Now, my dear sir, I am aware that this epistle\nis misquoted and misapprehended, not always inten\ntionally, but because the Bible is a sealed book a\nthe South, in consequence of the stultified condition\nof the moral perceptions, induced by the selfishness\nwhich is the necessary fruit of the exercise of un\nlimited power, and the desire to perpetuate it, and so\nthose little but very significant words which I have\nquoted escape notice, although the whole sense o\nthe letter depends upon them. If, then, the aboli\ntionists, who feel such devilish sympathy' for those\nhappy birds of paradise, can once have as full an as\nsurance that the patriarchs of the South will even\ndo more than they shall ask, as Paul had of the\nready acquisence of Philemon in the case quoted, i\npromise you that we will imitate his example joyful-\nly, whenever a slave comes among ns, who has run\naway from his corn, and sweet potatoes, rice, ground-\nnuts, poultry, eggs, &c; and will not only endeavor\nto convert him (for that must be done first,) but, when\nconverted, send him back to his peaceful, happy and\nEden-like lot, with the consciousness that he is not\na mere animal, but a MAN; and with the assurance\nthat he will be looked upon, not as a chattel, not as\na thing, but as an equal with the white man, socially\nand civilly. And we shall rejoice to have them all\nrunaway in their turn, that we may convert them\nand send them back unfettered, disenthralled, FREE.\nSlavery would thus be abolished, and the quandam\nslave stand forth in all the dignity of MAN. And\nhe will, under such circumstances, truly rejoice to\nreturn; for I have never seen a fugitive from slavery,\nwho did not declare, that if slavery were abolished,\nhe would immediately go back;' the climate being\nmore congenial to his constitution and habits, than\nthe cold regions of New-England and the British\nprovinces. It is but a few days since we had an op-\nportunity of imitating the example of Paul in the\ncase of another Paul, who came here from the South,\nand who said he would return if he conld do so and\nbe free; but under the existing state of things he\nrefused to be converted, and we were under the ne-\ncessity of assisting him to secure an asylum in the\ndominions of the Queen. A peck of corn a week,\nor a bushel of sweet potatoes,' seems to me rather\nscant fare for a laboring man, and no doubt the salt\nmeat, or salt fish, occasionally, is quite a rarity; but\nI am not sure that this simple fare may not be cal-\nculated to render them physically and morally better,\n(provided they have enough with time to cook it\nproperly,) than if they were indulged in the gourman-\ndizing habits, for which the whites are so notorious,\nthat the answer to the question in the catechism, (if\nthey have one,) What is the chief end of man?\nmight properly be-Idleness and gluttony.\nI am glad, my dear Sir, to learn that they are fur-\nnished, of course,' with summer and winter clothing,\nfor previous to the abolition movement, the young,\nduring the summer were, of course,' left in a state\nof perfect nudity: so here I recognize another in-\nstance of the improving influence of our labors; and\nin relation to the commission of crime, I have the\nmost unshaken confidence in what you say upon\nthat point, (not because you say it, but because it is\nconfirmed by better evidence ;) for I believe that\nthey are morally far superior to their masters, as a\ngeneral rule, and I likewise rejoice to know that you\nhave no fears of having your throat cut, for before\nthe abolitionists began to manifest the devilish\nsympathy' which so disturbs your quiet, there was a\nvery general fear upon that subject; and we have\nthe evidence of how inuch better, both morally and\nphysically, these people would be as free citizens,\nwhen the distant hope of freedom, some time or other,\nfor themselves or their children, can tend to allay\nthe cause of dread which the oppressor always must\nfeel, when he contemplates the sense of wrong\nwhich rankles in the hearts of his victims. I sin-\ncerely wish, my dear Sir, that they may never hurt\na hair of your head in any case, but that when they\nlock you up, as you say they do at night, they would\nkeep you locked up and feed you upon\ncorn a week, or sweet potatoes, with occasionally a\nlittle salt meat, or salt fish, till slavery were abolish-\npeck of ed; and of this case I truly wish it might be said,\net uno disce omnes throughout the whole South.\nI have no doubt of the exceeding love the slaves\nhear to those who use their services without wages,\nand give them not for their work, and separate hus-\nbands and wives, parents and children from each\nother, at will, and sell them like cattle in the market:\nI have heard some of them describe that love,) and\nI have sufficient evidence of their panting desire for\nfreedom, under any circumstances, in the account\ngiven by one John McDonogh of the emancipation\nof his own slaves, detailed by him in the New-Or-\nleans Bulletin, though he was unquestionably the\nbest master in all the South.\nBut it is not the mere physical condition of the\nslaves that excites the devilish sympathy' of aboli-\nlitionists. It is their moral state and the inoral state\nof the slaveholders, which is much the worst of the\ntwo. Your invitation to the Doctor, who intends to\nwrite a book, to visit your plantation, that El Dorado\nof the slave, to see them lock you up at night and\nJet you out in the morning, is quite as amusing as\nthe way a lady in New Orleans gulled a gentleman\nfrom Bath in tbis state. She asked him to come and\nsee her children, and he went; and behold in an\nelegantly furnished parlor, playing on a Brussels\ncarpet, were two little woolly heads, with each a\ngreat chunk of pound cake in its hand.\nBut, my dear Sir, dont allow yourself to imagine\nthat the anti-slavery movement will be retarded,\nmuch less arrested, by any of these flimsy devices.\nThey only proclaim, in language not to be misun-\nderstood, that the temple of the horrid Moloch is\neven now tottering to its foundation, and re-\nmind me of the gnat that seated himself on the horn\nof the bull and imagined his weight to be a barden,\nbut was informed that neither was his presence felt,\nnor would his absence be perceived. We shall\nsurely redouble our efforts to prostrate the now tot-\ntering and crumbling edifice, and we acquire new\ncourage at such manifestations of its weakness, as\nthe correspondence between yourself and the learn-\ned Doctor afforis\nDismiss from your troubled soul, my dear Sir, all\napprehensions of any horrible results from abolition,\nexcept the horrible thought which robbers naturally\nfeel at being obliged to obtain their bread by honest\nindustry. We seek to effect our object entirely by\nmoral means, and are fully determined never to in-\nterfere with either masters or slaves in any other\nmanner. Of the siaveholders, not one is fit to die;\nand our efforts are directed to reach the consciences,\nand thus influence the conduct of all that are not\ngiven up to perish in their own delusions; for no\nprinciple will be settled, no moral object attained by\nabolishing slavery in any other way.\nBe assured, dear Sir, that we perfectly understand\nand intend to observe the principle of non-interfer-\nence, to which you allude as though we had viola-\nted it. We well know that we have nothing in a\nlegal or legislative point of view to do with your be-\ngetting your own chattles, or trading in the bodies\nand souls of your own sons and daughters in the in-\ndividual States. But we have something to do with\nit in the national capital, and we shall not cease to\nurge its abolition there, which we have a right to do\nand we intend to observe our duty to fugitive slaves\nand to their professed masters; that is, we mean to\nimitate Paul, when we are sure that the patriarchs\nwill emulate Philemon, and the slaves imitate One-\nsimus, in voluntarily returning and carrying our let-\nters to the master. But if slave-hunters follow their\nfugitives here, and attempt to take them, we shall\nuse no force to prevent them; but they will get no\nhelp in New-England, and the fugitive has the same\nright to defend himself that any other man has.\nWe have done quite enough with our blood and\ntreasure' to sustain kidnapping and piracy, but de-\npend upon it the North never will, ' in the very im-\nprobable emergency' to which you refer, move a\nhand or foot to arrest it; you must take care of your\nselves. This is fast becoming the settled policy of\nthe whole North.\nIn less than five years slavery will be abolished\nin the District of Columbia; the northern churches\nwill separate from the southern on that question, and\nthe plague-spot will soon pass away. In this you\nwill no doubt rejoice with us.\nThe fiat has gone\nforth. MenE, MENE, TEKLE,' is written upon the\nwalls of the citadel of oppression.\nA few years ago a solitary young man sent forth\nthe first sheet of the periodical in which this letter\nis published. It contained the following language\nwhich time has proved was prophetic. Let south-\nern oppressore tremble. Let their secret abettors trem-\nble. Let their northern apologists tremble. Let all\nthe enemies of the persecuted blacks tremble. I am in\nearnest. I will not equivocate. I will not ercuse. 1\nwill not retreat a single inch. AND I WILL BE\nHEARD. That young man was WILLIAM LLOYD\nGARRISON. You have heard of him, perhaps. AE\nthis time, his coadjutors number a host, animated\nby a like determined and unconquerable spirit.\nTheir number is constantly increasing, and they\nmust and will triumph.\nYours in the hope of the downfall of all oppres-\nsion,\nD.

(Indiana,) March 20, 1843.\nBrother GARRISON: We have recently re-\nceived a letter from the committee chosen to\ngive more extensive circulation to the Liberator\nThe few who read the Liberator, in this part of the\nworld, have long felt the importance of the subject\nThere is great need of knowledge in anti-slavery\ntruth. The Western world is asleep on the subject\nof American slavery. The indifference manifestec\nby the religious and political partyists of this coun\ntry is more universal and fatal than in the Eastern\nStates. Gross darkness covers the people, and re-\nform is impossible where there is such ignorance.\nThere are but few, even of the leading politicians\nof the country, that have any perception of the cause\nand origin of the troublous times that now oppress\nthe nation. In their minds, reform must begin with\nlegislation. This is the prescriptive nostram with\nwhich the aspirants to national office buy the votes\nof the unthinking, yet honest mechanic and farmer\nof this land. The people think that systems of law,\nconcocted by representatives and senators at the\nState capitol, have some magic power to alleviate\nthe woes and sufferings of the nation. They scarcely\nconceive that ceasing to do evil, and learning to do\nwell, is an essential prerequisite to wholesome leg-\nislation; and except local legislation proceed from\nsuch a source, no relief can be realized.\nSo long as such recklessness for humanity rules in\nthis State legislature as to suffer such foul blasts, in\nregard to colored people, to stain the statute book,\nthe people of the State cannot reasonably look for\njust and honest legisl ion for themselves. Noth-\ning but the deepest degradation in ignorance can\nallow of their electing men for office, who connive\nat such things. To pass over such injustice is to\nscoff at and tantalize the earnest entreaties of the\nsuffering poor white man, who prays for legislative\nrelief for himself. What man can be so foolhardy\nas to strive for and against the same thing? But\nall that meet to vote pro-slavery men into office, to\nmake a system of laws for the nation, must assuredly\ndo it. Time is fooled away at every day of elec-\ntion; and the man that advocates the idea of voting\non such principles is cursing the world. Certainly\nnothing but good and truth can purge the world;\nthen all efforts to do good on wrong principles are\nnot only abortive, but positively detrimental; who\nconfess legislation will not secure the happiness of\nsociety. Those who will legislate only for a class in\nthe community will forsake that class when it is for\ntheir interest. No man can love a white man that\nhates a colored man. He that will not legislate for\nthe colored man, ought not to have my franchise-\ncannot be trusted with the rights of the nation\nwill involve in ruin his friends, when his own pri-\nvate interests, disconnected from all mankind, de-\nmand it. If we will vote, let the first thing de-\ntermined on be, 'Are you willing to do what justice\nand mercy require ?' Then, whatever wrongs the\nman of color endures, will be removed; and this\nwould constitute alone evidence that the man will do\nme justice in legislation.\nThe priest comes forward and asserts that religion\nis man's salvation. The anxious-seat is our hope of\nredemption. To mourn religiously and popnlarly\nfor sins will alleviate human woe, though it confirms\nus in the practise of forging chains and erecting\ngallows. The clergy preach that man is divinely\ndivided into grades, and the one shall be the ser-\nvants of the other. The dupes of such clerical vil-\nlany are contented to serve, and to force others into\nthe service. The priest proclaims a common pa-\nrentage, common God, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and\nthen basely tramples in the dust the dearest rights\nof the great mass.\nThis part teems with priests as\nmuch as ever France did. All are contending for\ntheir part of the people. The crowd swallow their\ndivine prescriptions as though they were heavenly\nantidotes given the aristocracy by the direct com-\nmunication from Deity. There are so many divine\nteachers here, that only a few are left to practice.\nThe heavenly oracles uttered are expected to benefit\nonly those who are of like sentiments; so each re- ligious demagogue does not anticipate honor from\nany, until he has converted them to his faith. The\nholy days here are occupied by all varieties. One\nman preaches Christ in one way, another in another\nway. The stomach and brains of the populace are\nso crammed by the Jesuits with religion, that hu-\nmanity sounds like phariseeism. To talk of science\nand literature, temperance, justice, human rights\nfor both male and female--in fine, to say that the\nperfection of the social system, the establishing of\ntruth over the ruins of slavery, was the great end\nChrist had in living and dying in this world-is\nFrench infidelity, and will confirm man in a still\ndeeper degradation than he is now. Religion alone\nis the antidote for suffering, and that religion dis-\nconnected from all acts of humanity. The Sabbath\nmust be consecrated to God, ever at man's expense.\nNothing that will do good to the body and intellect\nof man ought to be spoken on the Sabbath. Re-\nligion should sanctify the day. He that would pre-\ntend to talk of the slave pining in chains, the drunk-\nard wallowing in the mire, or brutalizing his family-\nor to meet for the cultivation of the science of mu-\nsic, is sacrilegious, and a defamation of God's cha-\nracter, and shows a want of reverence for his holy\nname. The nation meet for the blessing of Jehovah\non Sunday; then, and as soon as the clerical robe is\nthrown off, curse humanity. Here the clergy advise\nmost devoutly the advocates of humanity to save\ntheir breath' for more honorable purposes than the\nlow, dirty calling Jesus Christ was engaged in-i.e.\npreaching deliverence to the captives, and the un-\nbinding the heavy burdens. The clergy here defame\nthe name and character of any that attempt to do\nany thing for the relief of human woe beyond dom-\nination. They stand aghast at the discussions for\njustice and equality of the human family ; for when\nall are perfectly scientific, which will be in perfect\norganization of Society, then there will be justice,\nand there will be no need of a clerical aristocracy\nto preach faith and Sunday holiness\"; for then all wil\nbe led by science to love their neighbors as them-\nselves. What consternation would fill the ranks of\nthe clergy! There would be nc occasion for clerical\nexhortations, and a large class in society would be\nthrown out of employ, driven to the necessity of man-\nual labor, or open theft.\nNow they commit theft, under cover of an as-\nsumed divine warrant. The order of priests neces-\nsarily implies slavery. There must be slaves to\ntoil for their support, so long as they maintain their\nstanding. Slavery will never cease, so long as there\nis such an abusive idea in regard to the clergy. To\nsay that they have rights above others, implies a de-\nprivation of rights in others, consequently inferior-\nity, not of mental or physical energy, but of artifi-\ncial, unjust immunities, concocted, and mutually\nconferred by the rich and powerful.\nThis is almost all that is done for the cause of\nman's redemption in this State. The priest can\npray, shout, sing psalms, and bring society to their\nknees; and then suffer them to imbrue their hands\nin a brother's blood. The politician talks of honest\nlegislators, and then nominates himself as a fit leg-\nislator. This is the whole of the labor attempted\nhere. Both are foolish, selfish, and unconcerned\nfor those whom they persuade to be their supporters\nThey do not care for their supporters as men, for\nthen they would care for any man. They regard\nnone but partizans. He that will pay the clerical\ntax, and defend the clergy with concern for their\nwelfare, will meet the approbation of the clergy.-\nThe inquiry is, whether he is of the same party, and\nfaithful ; if so, then all is right. Nither thinks of\nhumanity. The priest would fear that his black\nsuit would be tarnished to pray for the colored man.\nAnd, indeed, a prayer from such a man would fal\nupon the limbs of the slave like a blighting simoon\nTo think of reforming society with such means is\nthe height of absurdity. Corruption increases unde\nsuch influence. The politician desires the offices\nof government, but he gives no evidence that he is\nfitted for them. He will not seek by his legislation\nto relieve the distresses of the people. We hear the\nman preach, and he tells us of being born again,\nloving God, being damned if we do not believe, being\nburnt, without being consumed, in an ignitable lake\nof brimstone; all this, and much more. But we do\nnot see them doing as they would be done by; we\ndo not hear them advising men to fly the sin of sla\nvery, and all the abominations of injustice. They\nsay, 'Get religion, but they say you can sell your\nbrother; love God with all your soul, even if you\nhave to curse man with all the malignity the tongue\nis capable of.\nThe nation is convulsed by politics and religion,\nand those who will not pray, and sanctify the holy-\ndays, and attend elections, are execrated as unfit for\nsociety; whilst the slave clanks his chains under\nthe pulpit, and in the capital of American liberties.\nNow, either the politics and religion of the land are\nspurious, or else truth is not purifying in its nature\nThe latter is surely true; of course, then, we must\nseek salvation from the corruption of society, from\nsome other means than by popular notions of reli-\ngion and politics. Truth will save us; then we are\nall believing a lie. The more zealous for religion\nor politics an individual is, the more fatal to the in-\nterests of humanity will be his toil. The more that\nis done wrong, the worse will be the condition of\nthose to whom the wrong is done. This nation is\nsuffering by excessive legislation, and on account of\nincrease of religions. Let there be less of the pres-\nent politics and preaching, then society would come\nto their senses. Each would think more for him-\nself; and then there would be more intelligent\naction. Instead of the foolish, unintelligible ser-\nmon, let there be a developing of the wrong of the\nsocial system, and means devised for the correction\nof them; then mankind will begin to realize salva-\ntion. So long as the Sabbath is made the only day\nto meet together upon, and nothing concerning the\nwoes and miseries of society to be discussed on that\nday, so long shall we feel the present throes with-\nout hope of deliverance. We have long enongh\nlooked for deliverance in another world. This idea\nhas long enough been swallowed by the sects,\npalmed off on them by the vicegerents of heaven.\nIt is time for us to experiment for present salvation.\nThe burden and woes of human being are becoming\nintolerable. All that is necessary is to throw off\nthe burden. Let us turn our backs on these dumb-\ndogs, (D. D.'s,) and such as are Licensed to Lie\nDreadfully, (L. L. D.'s,) and spend the time of as-\nsembling on the Sabbath, and other times of con-\ngregating, for the purpose of finding out means for\npresent relief; then will this world assume a new\naspect. Then slavery and war, chains and swords,\nscourges and gallows, soul-drivers and hangmen,\nwould call on the rocks and mountains to hide them\nfrom the face of truth and its triumphs.\nPRENTICE H. EVANS.\nN. B. We want more light. My Liberators are\nseized and read with avidity, as soon as received.\nThey are constantly on the wing until worn out.-\nTalk to my neighbors of taking it--- Hard times' is\nthe answer.

It is a little singular that those who,\nin most respects, have been such staunch support-\ners of that original platform,' (the Declaration of\nSentiments,) should now refuse to encourage the\nlabor of freeman rather than that of slaves, by giv-\ning preference to the productions of the former.\nViewing the subject in the light of either duty or\nexpediency, their course is equally inexplicable.

A Christian has\nno right any where, or under any circunstances, to\nbe any thing else than a Christian. He must ask about\na political as well as any other act, the question is a\nright or wrong--and by the answer to that question\nhe must be guided. It is just as immoral to act\nwithout reference to the law of God in a caucus, as\nany where else. To prefer our own interest or par-\nty to that of our country, is treason against that\ncountry and sin against God. And it makes no\nmatter whether that treason be perpetrated with a\nballot or a bayonet, at the caucus or in the field.\nAnd still more, no man can more surely be putting\nan end to his religion than by frequenting any cir-\ncle which he must enter without his religion.

Evils like these\nmust be known before they can be remedied ; yet\nthe generality of the upper ranks know little what\ntheir inferiors suffer.\nDEVOTION. Devotion, like fire in the frosty\nweather, burns hottest in affliction. With the ark\nof Noah, the higher we are tossed with its flood,\nthe nearer we mount towards heaven. When the\nwaters of the flood came upon the face of the earth,\ndown went stately turrets and towers, but as the\nwater rose, the ark rose still higher. In like sort,\nwhen the waters of affliction arise, down goes the\npride of life, the lust of the eyes, and the vanity of\nthe world.---But the ark of the soul ariseth, as\nthese waters arise, and that higher and higher, even\nnearer towards heaven. O, admirable use of afflic-\ntion ; health from a wound ; cure from a disease ;\nout of grief, joy ; gain out of loss ; out of infirmity,\nstrength; out of sin, holiness ; out of death, life.\nHow impossible is it to break down and render\nuseless a truly christian spirit! He that possesses it,\nmay be abused and imprisoned ; but the great\nsource of his enjoyment no enemy can touch ; of\nthe means of growth and knowledge in holiness he\ncannot be deprived ; nor can he be so shut out from\nthe world as not to do good. Shut him up with\nothers, and they shall feel the influence of his in-\nstructions, and his character. Confine him alone,\nand prohibit all intercourse between him and the\nworld, and so much the more shall the salutary in-\nfluence of his piety be felt, wherever his name is\nheard. Kill him, and you but extend and perpet-\nuate the memory and the power of his virtues.\nThe Sun of Righteousness.-As all the can-\ndles in the world cannot make a day when the sun\nis set, so all the cornforts in the Universe cannot\ncheer the heart of the believer in the absence of the\nSun of Righteousness.

But she refused this offer, as also to meet\nhim in the streets that evening, consenting, howev-\ner, to see him at her mother's house. Accordingly\nhe went to her mother,s house, where he remained\nuntil half past 10, when the mother told him it was\ntiine to retire. He then asked, if he might remain\nwith Sally, but was refused. Sally then rose with\na light, and proceeded to the staircase. As she\nplaced her foot upon the second stair, the prisoner,\nwho had followed, asked her why she was in such\nhaste? On her turning to reply, she received two\nballs, discharged from a pistol fired by the prisoner.\nSally shrieked ; the mother ran to her assistance ;\nand a Mr Shepherd, an inmate, soon made his ap-\npearance, having been aroused by two reports of\npistols. Samuel Hatch, a neighbor, who soon\ncame to the scene of violence, on learning who had\ncommitted the act, demanded where the prisoner\nwas to be found, and was answered by a faint voice\nfrom the kitchen,' I am here.' On proceeding to\nthe kitchen, he found the prisoner stretched upon\nhis back, his coat and pistol lying near him. Blood\nbeing observed, the prisoner was asked, if he was\nwounded? and answered, that he was ; but meant,\npointing to his heart, to put the charge there, On\nbeing asked, if he was not sorry for the deed ? he\nreplied, that he was sorry to give Sally any pain ;\nintended both should die without pain. The balls\nby which the complainant was shot, passed through\nher abdomen, and escaped at the back, The pris-\noner was shot in the lower and fleshy part of his\nleft arm. - It appeared that prisoner had hired a\nroom in Mrs Moore's house ; had been intimate\nwith Sally two years, &c.\nThe plea set up for the prisoner was Insanity.\nTwo physicians testified that, last spring, they\nattended on prisoner at his request. He was then\ngloomy and depressed , spoke but little; but, when\nhe said any thing, dwelt on his love for Sally\nMoore. Another witness, a woman, testified that\nhe was at her house last Spring, and seemed much\ndepressed ; sometimes read; sometimes walked\nbackwards and forwards ; and once lay in bed a\nwhole day.\nMr Ichabod Bartlett, for prisoner, took the\nground, that Tash was distracted with Love. He\ncontended that love had, upon one subject, made\nhim the victim of that derangement, which is called\nmonomania. He labored this point at some length.\nMr G. Sullivan, Attorney General, in reply, a-\nmong other things, said :\n\u2022 It is contended that, tho' he did not converse, he\nacted irrationally, which is a proof of insanity. But\nthis is a doctrine, fraught with ten thousand evils-\nany person may fall in love-kill the object of his\npassion-all for love--and be acquitted! A person\nmay counterfeit a passion for a woman--he may\nrepeatedly declare, in the presence of witnesses,\nhow dearly he loves her, procure pistols, and prove\nhis affection by shooting her. The action is evi-\ndence of insanity, and he is acquitted! Let us not\nbe insane on the subject of insanity.'\nThe case having been submitted to the Jury,\nthey returned a verdict of Guilty ; recominending\nprisoner to the favorable consideration of the\nCourt.\nAfter verdict, prisoner's counsel moved an arrest\nof judgment on the following grounds, viz:-\n. That the Jury were mis-directed by the Court\nin matter of law in this :-That the term malice a-\nforethought in the charge of murder, meant nothing\nmore than that the respondent intended to do the\nact, without any regard to the motive.\n\u2022 That the Court stated to the Jury, that suicide\nis committed by persons of s\u1ea3ne mind-and that\nthe attempt by the prisoner to commit suicide, was\nnot proof of insanity.'\nThese exceptions were filed, and will be argued\nat the next term of the Superior Court. The pris-\noner was held to recognize in the sum of one hun-\nEred and fifty dollars for his appearance.

The\nProvincial Government at Rio can hardly be very\nefficient, or much respected, when a President,\nsent by it to Para, was obliged to flee for his\nlife, and the Vice President put in irons. The\ndisturbance at Para, however, arose, as almost\nall such dissentions do, with the troops, who had\nsome right to their pay, but who probably had as\nmuch appetite for plunder. They are a motley col-\nlection, and motley should be their only\nwear.' They are of all colors that sun and shade\ncan produce in men\u2014some wear wigs\u2014others\nwear their own hair, but a far greater number\nwear their own wool. Inconsiderable, and ill-\nconditioned, and ill-favored as the army is, there\nis much danger that it will make mischief in Bra-\nzil. An army has as little conscience, collective-\nly, as any other body of men, even Bank Direct-\nors ; it will, like a mad dog, bite the hand that\nfeeds it\u2014but is far more apt to snap at the fingers\nthat do not feed it. The more it is fed, too, the\nmore it will devour. The army, though not pow-\nerful in itself, has, or may have when pressed,\npowerful allies in the negroes and Indians. The\nslaves, even in Rio, where white merchants\nmost do congregate,' are in the proportion of two\nto one white. There are 50,000 whites and 100,-\n000 slaves, and in the country, the disparity must\nbe greater. Long ago, the people of Rio felt this\nto be so dangerous a preponderance of the physi-\ncal over the moral, that they encouraged divisions\nand bloodshed among the slaves, and accordingly\nmany lives were lost in the battles of the Congo-\nese against the Angolese, or of one tribe against\nanother. Heretofore the apple of discord has\nbeen so often thrown among the blacks, that they\nhave had little time to reflect upon their own ad-\nvantage. When this is pointed out to them by\nany body of the whites who will encourage, and\nin some sort organize them, Heaven have mercy\non Brazil !--There is no country in the world\nwhere anarchy would be so exterminating in its\neffects--a tornado, that would sweep man and his\nmonuments of labor from the land, would be, in\ncomparison, a visitation of mercy. The massa-\ncres and consternations of St Domingo would be\na holiday play compared with the murder and\nhavoc that will fall upon Brazil. The forests, e-\nven in the vicinity of cities, are tangled recesses,\nwhere a serpent can scarcely glide, and where an-\nimals have often to leap from tree to tree. In no\ncountry do the woods afford such security and\nsupport for outlaws. The blacks, if driven from\nthe cities and the open fields, could make such a stand for years in the forests, that the earth could\nnot be cultivated. The whites would hardly at-\ntempt to cultivate it, and if they should, it must\nbe as the companions of Boone planted in Ken-\ntucky-standing back to back, to take in the\nwhole horizon, and holding a spade in one hand\nand a gun in the other. The Indians too, who\nare of a ferocious race, would find occasion to\nstrike when a blow would be felt.

(!!)\nThe late outrage at Southampton has awakened\nus into vigilance-the harsh laws which humanity\nhad almost effaced from our penal code, have been\nrevived ; but it has by no means excited our fears\nto the extent which our northern brethren had sup-\nposed. Virginia takes the miseries of slavery with\nresolute philosophy, (!) not with shuddering coward-\nice, and is prepared in any event to sustain the poli-\ncy of her slave code, both with firmness and justice.\nThe stern retribution which the banditti of South-\nampton received, has afforded a salutary lesson to\nthe wretched instruments of infuriated fanaticism,\nand its force is now felt throughout every plantation\nof the state. It has also whispered a tone of self-\ncongratulation to the pride of every planter. (!!) It\nboldly declared the general affectionate fidelity and\ndevoted constancy of the slave. (!)

For God's sake, urge\nyour over-righteous philanthropists to eschew all\nspeculations on our slavery. It not only renders the\ncontented slave miserable, but diminishes the gener-\nous and confident protection of the master.

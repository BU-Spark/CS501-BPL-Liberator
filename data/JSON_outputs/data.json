                    "ocr_text": "FOREIGN ITEMS.\nIt is stated from London, Ja. 4, that Don Miguel\nwas seriously indisposed-his recovery doubtful.\nThere is some trouble brewing in the Royal fam-\nily. As all the illegitimate sons of the King by Mrs\nJordan have been, or are to be advanced to the\npeerage, the children of the Duke of Sussex, by La-\ndy Augusta Murray, are setting up their claims also.\nCholera.-While this disease was dying away\nin the quarter where it first broke out, and was con-\nfined for some time within a comparatively small\ncircuit, it was extending its ravages northward, and\nthere was no average diminution of the number of\ncases reported. Total number of cases up to 230,\n2377 ; deaths, 801.\nLe Temps says-A report was current on Satur-\nday night, that the Emperor Nicholas had been up-\nset and dangerously hurt during a pleasure excursion\non a sledge. It was added, that the person who\naccompanied his majesty, was killed on the spot.\nLetters from Gibraltar announce the death of\nGen. Don, late Governor of that garrison. He died\nof an influenza and a severe cough, which has\nproved futal to every person whom it has yet at-\ntacked.\nThe Emperor of Russia was about to visit the\nPrussian capital. One account states that he had\nactually taken his departure from St Petersburgh.\nUpon this subject, the Courier says: We leave it to\npoliticians to speculate upon the motives of his jour-\nney; but it must be something very important to\ninduce the Emperor to quit St Petersburgh at this sea-\nson of the year.\nAmong the fashions prevailing just now at Paris,\nis that of wearing ten breadths in the skirt of the\ndress. In one of Jouy's papers, in L'Hermite de\nla Chausse d'Antin,' he makes the old lady declare\nthat the brocade of her wedding suit was alierwards\nmade into covers for a sofa and a dozen arm chairs,\nand it seems likely that so curious an epoch of fash-\nion will be renewed.\nExtraordinary Wager.-Mr Udny, the vener-\nable Postmaster of Lisniere, Bedfordshire, undertook,\nfor a wager, to travel from that town to Latmore, in\nan oyster barrel, drawn by a pig, a badger, two\ncats, a goose and a hedgehog. His head was dec-\norated with a red night-cap, and he drove with a\npig-driver's whip. He is in his 97th year.\nThe gigantic Book.-We translate the follow-\ning paragraph froni Le Globe, of the 19th ult.\n\u2022 The largest book that ever went to press, will ap-\npear next year in London. It will be entitled \" The\nPantheon of English Heroes.\u201d Every page will be\ntwenty-four feet high by twelve broad, and the let-\nters hall a foot long. It has been necessary to con-\nstruct a machine for the fabrication of the paper.\nThis gigantic work will be printed by means of a\nsteam engine, and, instead of black ink, gold var-\nnish will be used. Only one hundred copies will\nbe struck off, intended as the ornaments of the prin-\ncipal English libraries.'-Literury Gazeite.\n6",

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion. A per-\nson standing near him caught his coat to hold\nhim, but as the order was given to fire he made a\nspring, broke loose from the hold, and was before\nthe nouth of the gun just as it went off. His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together. The\nupper part, consisting of the head, arms, and\nbreast, was thrown thirty or forty feet in the air,\nand struck the ground about thirty feet from the\nother portion.\nWorthy of notice. The fine ship Alert, be-\nlonging to Messrs. Perkins & Co. of Boston, com-\nmanded by James W. Seaver, Esq. of Kingston,\nMass. recently arrived here from Canton, has per-\nformed her voyage from Boston to Europe, from\nthence to Canton and back, in the unprecedented\ntime of nine months and twenty days, having de-\nlivered and received four full cargoes in her ab-\nsence, during which time not a drop of ardent\nspirits has been used by the officers and crew, or\nby any visitor on board, having left the country\nwithout any of any description, except a small\nquantity of eau de vie,' as a medicine, for which,\nfrom their continual good health during the voy-\nage, they found no necessity to call to their aid.\n- Journal of Commerce.\nCincinnati, Feb. 29.-Every day brings us,\nand every day shows us, further ravages of this\ngreat and sweeping calamity. A gentleman of\nunquestionable veracity informs us that in one\nhundred miles distance, above the mouth of Cum-\nberland, he counted sixty-nine houses afloat on\nthe Ohio in a single day, between sunrise and\nsunset. Lawrenceburg, only about twenty miles\nbelow us, we are informed, was so completely\ninundated, that not a family was left in the place,\nall having fled to the high ground in the neigh-\nborhood, and in that distressed situation, compel-\nled to abide the peltings of the pitiless storm,'\nand endure the severe cold which followed it.\nWe learn from good authority, that the late\nrise exceeded that of 1793 by three feet six inch-\nes, and that of 1815 by five feet ten inches. In\nour counting room 4th story Latham's buildings,\nthe water was eight feet two inches deep.\nAn enormous iron chest has been built for the\nNew-York Savings Bank, 21 feet wide and 11\nfeet high.",

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW.

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

                    "ocr_text": "LETTER FROM HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\nTo the Editors of the N. Y. Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

                    "ocr_text": "CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ENGLISH PRESS.\nBY CHARLES L. BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

                    "ocr_text": "a\nLet us recall briefly to our English readers what\nthis war really is. And in the first place, let us\nlave done, once and forever, with the talk about its\nbeing a war of rival tariffs.\nProtection and Free Trade have nothing to do\nwith it. The Protective System originated with\nthe South. Every tariff has passed by Southern\nvotes. There has been no session in which the\nSouth and the (so-called) Free-Trade Democracy\nof the North could not have controlled the legisla-\ntion of Congress. More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

Whence\ncomes the necessity for this uprising of the people ?\nTo these questions, there can be but one answer.\nSLAVERY HAS DONE IT. That accursed system,\nwhich has already cost us so much, has at length cul-\nminated in this present ruin and confusion. That\nsystem must be put down. The danger must never\nbe suffered to occur again. The evil must be eradi-\ncated, cost what it may. We are for no half-way\nSo long as the slave system kept itself\nwithin the limits of the Constitution, we were bound\nto let it alone, and to respect its legal rights; but\nwhen, overleaping those limits, it bids defiance to all\nlaw, and lays its vile hands on the sacred altar of\nliberty and the sacred flag of the country, and would\noverturn the Constitution itself, thenceforth slavery\nhas no longer any constitutional rights. It is by its\nown act an outlaw. It can never come back again\ninto the temple, and claim a place by right among\nthe worshippers of truth and liberty.

It is not so. So far from this,\nslavery is the very heart and head of this whole\nstruggle. The conflict is between freedom on the\none hand, maintaining its rights, and slavery on the\nother, usurping and demanding that to which it has\nno right. It is a war of principle as well as of self-\npreservation; and that is but a miserable and short-\nsighted policy which looks merely at the danger, and\noverlooks the cause; which seeks merely to put out\nthe fire, and lets the incendiary go at large, to re-\npeat the experiment at his leisure.

                    "ocr_text": "up\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE SLAVES\nEMANCIPATED BY WAR?\nThe popular instinct, which goes right to the trut\nof the matter, says, \u201c Slavery made the war; let i\ntake the consequences of war.\u201d We expect tha\nnothing more just than that could be proclaimed\nfrom Sinai itself. But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

Some sacrifices of\nnominal and pretended property, and of unworthy\nprejudices, must indeed be made ; and let these be\n;\nbalanced by the unspeakable advantages to be reap-\ned, and the unrequitable though just claims on the\nother side.

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

                    "ocr_text": "IMPORTANT CORRECTION.\nI am happy to find by the following letter,\nthat Mr Ladd, in the most obnoxious portion of\nhis speech, delivered at the annual meeting of the\nColonization Society, used the logic of slavehold-\ners and not his own. Several gentlemen who\nwere present on that occasion, drew inferences\nfrom Mr L's remarks similar to my own. After\nstating the argument of southern men-stealers,\nrelative to teaching the slaves to read the bible,\nhe added, if my memory be accurate,- Now,\nMr President, I, for one, am not prepared to wit-\nness this state of things.' The meaning of this\ndeclaration I construed as follows: \u201cAs a lover\nof peace, Mr President, and a discourager of ser-\nvile insurrections, I am not prepared to see the\nslaves possess that knowledge which alone is\nwanting to induce them to perpetrate acts of tar-\nbarity and retaliation, at which humanity must\nshudder.' Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

It will\nbe recollected that in his challenge to Anti-Colo-\nnizationists, Mr Orr prescribed the same terms\n(with a trifling exception) as did the Shade of\nAshmun. This circumstance induced me to think\nthat Mr Orr was the Shade of Ashraun.\nWe are likewise reminded that my attack on\nMr 0. was published in the N. Y. Sentinel, a\npaper which was not included in the conditions\nstipulated by the Shade of Ashmun.' Very well.\nI did not address the Shade of Ashmun, nor did\nI contemplate holding the controversy with him ;\non the contrary, it was expressly understood that\nthe controversy, on his part, was to be relinquish-\ned, unless he should consent to comply with my\nrequisitions. The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility! What cunning geniuses coloniza-\ntionists are !!\nThis is no time to cavil; the subject of Colo-\nnization is too weighty to be trifled with.\nDo I now challenge the Rev. Isaac Orr to\ndiscuss the merits of the American Colonization\nSociety with me upon the following terms : Mr\nOrr shall reply to the article aldressed to him\npublished in the N. Y. Sentinel of Dec. 24. The\narticles of the controversy shall be published in\nthe American Spectator, shall be alternato, and\noccupy an equal proportion of space. A copy of\nthe papers, containing said articles, to be directed\nto me in this city.\nWe shall now have an opportunity to test Mr\nOrr's courage and sincerity.'\nGARDNER JONES.\nNew-York, March 7th, 1832.\n'my",

What must be the constituents of\nsuch a representative?\nMr. Speaker, I am almost afraid to trust myseli\non this subject ; but representing a free people, i\nought to speak as I know they would speak, were\nthey personally present, and I know they would fling\ndefiance in your very teeth on this subject. To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance. I war gentlemen what they do. The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

His perso\nis good, his manner free and graceful, and his\naccent peculiar, such as marks the Indian fron\nthe white man. His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

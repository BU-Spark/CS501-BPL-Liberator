                    "ocr_text": "FOREIGN ITEMS.\nIt is stated from London, Ja. 4, that Don Miguel\nwas seriously indisposed-his recovery doubtful.\nThere is some trouble brewing in the Royal fam-\nily. As all the illegitimate sons of the King by Mrs\nJordan have been, or are to be advanced to the\npeerage, the children of the Duke of Sussex, by La-\ndy Augusta Murray, are setting up their claims also.\nCholera.-While this disease was dying away\nin the quarter where it first broke out, and was con-\nfined for some time within a comparatively small\ncircuit, it was extending its ravages northward, and\nthere was no average diminution of the number of\ncases reported. Total number of cases up to 230,\n2377 ; deaths, 801.\nLe Temps says-A report was current on Satur-\nday night, that the Emperor Nicholas had been up-\nset and dangerously hurt during a pleasure excursion\non a sledge. It was added, that the person who\naccompanied his majesty, was killed on the spot.\nLetters from Gibraltar announce the death of\nGen. Don, late Governor of that garrison. He died\nof an influenza and a severe cough, which has\nproved futal to every person whom it has yet at-\ntacked.\nThe Emperor of Russia was about to visit the\nPrussian capital. One account states that he had\nactually taken his departure from St Petersburgh.\nUpon this subject, the Courier says: We leave it to\npoliticians to speculate upon the motives of his jour-\nney; but it must be something very important to\ninduce the Emperor to quit St Petersburgh at this sea-\nson of the year.\nAmong the fashions prevailing just now at Paris,\nis that of wearing ten breadths in the skirt of the\ndress. In one of Jouy's papers, in L'Hermite de\nla Chausse d'Antin,' he makes the old lady declare\nthat the brocade of her wedding suit was alierwards\nmade into covers for a sofa and a dozen arm chairs,\nand it seems likely that so curious an epoch of fash-\nion will be renewed.\nExtraordinary Wager.-Mr Udny, the vener-\nable Postmaster of Lisniere, Bedfordshire, undertook,\nfor a wager, to travel from that town to Latmore, in\nan oyster barrel, drawn by a pig, a badger, two\ncats, a goose and a hedgehog. His head was dec-\norated with a red night-cap, and he drove with a\npig-driver's whip. He is in his 97th year.\nThe gigantic Book.-We translate the follow-\ning paragraph froni Le Globe, of the 19th ult.\n\u2022 The largest book that ever went to press, will ap-\npear next year in London. It will be entitled \" The\nPantheon of English Heroes.\u201d Every page will be\ntwenty-four feet high by twelve broad, and the let-\nters hall a foot long. It has been necessary to con-\nstruct a machine for the fabrication of the paper.\nThis gigantic work will be printed by means of a\nsteam engine, and, instead of black ink, gold var-\nnish will be used. Only one hundred copies will\nbe struck off, intended as the ornaments of the prin-\ncipal English libraries.'-Literury Gazeite.\n6",

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion. A per-\nson standing near him caught his coat to hold\nhim, but as the order was given to fire he made a\nspring, broke loose from the hold, and was before\nthe nouth of the gun just as it went off. His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together. The\nupper part, consisting of the head, arms, and\nbreast, was thrown thirty or forty feet in the air,\nand struck the ground about thirty feet from the\nother portion.\nWorthy of notice. The fine ship Alert, be-\nlonging to Messrs. Perkins & Co. of Boston, com-\nmanded by James W. Seaver, Esq. of Kingston,\nMass. recently arrived here from Canton, has per-\nformed her voyage from Boston to Europe, from\nthence to Canton and back, in the unprecedented\ntime of nine months and twenty days, having de-\nlivered and received four full cargoes in her ab-\nsence, during which time not a drop of ardent\nspirits has been used by the officers and crew, or\nby any visitor on board, having left the country\nwithout any of any description, except a small\nquantity of eau de vie,' as a medicine, for which,\nfrom their continual good health during the voy-\nage, they found no necessity to call to their aid.\n- Journal of Commerce.\nCincinnati, Feb. 29.-Every day brings us,\nand every day shows us, further ravages of this\ngreat and sweeping calamity. A gentleman of\nunquestionable veracity informs us that in one\nhundred miles distance, above the mouth of Cum-\nberland, he counted sixty-nine houses afloat on\nthe Ohio in a single day, between sunrise and\nsunset. Lawrenceburg, only about twenty miles\nbelow us, we are informed, was so completely\ninundated, that not a family was left in the place,\nall having fled to the high ground in the neigh-\nborhood, and in that distressed situation, compel-\nled to abide the peltings of the pitiless storm,'\nand endure the severe cold which followed it.\nWe learn from good authority, that the late\nrise exceeded that of 1793 by three feet six inch-\nes, and that of 1815 by five feet ten inches. In\nour counting room 4th story Latham's buildings,\nthe water was eight feet two inches deep.\nAn enormous iron chest has been built for the\nNew-York Savings Bank, 21 feet wide and 11\nfeet high.",

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW.

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

                    "ocr_text": "LETTER FROM HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\nTo the Editors of the N. Y. Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

                    "ocr_text": "CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ENGLISH PRESS.\nBY CHARLES L. BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

                    "ocr_text": "a\nLet us recall briefly to our English readers what\nthis war really is. And in the first place, let us\nlave done, once and forever, with the talk about its\nbeing a war of rival tariffs.\nProtection and Free Trade have nothing to do\nwith it. The Protective System originated with\nthe South. Every tariff has passed by Southern\nvotes. There has been no session in which the\nSouth and the (so-called) Free-Trade Democracy\nof the North could not have controlled the legisla-\ntion of Congress. More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

Whence\ncomes the necessity for this uprising of the people ?\nTo these questions, there can be but one answer.\nSLAVERY HAS DONE IT. That accursed system,\nwhich has already cost us so much, has at length cul-\nminated in this present ruin and confusion. That\nsystem must be put down. The danger must never\nbe suffered to occur again. The evil must be eradi-\ncated, cost what it may. We are for no half-way\nSo long as the slave system kept itself\nwithin the limits of the Constitution, we were bound\nto let it alone, and to respect its legal rights; but\nwhen, overleaping those limits, it bids defiance to all\nlaw, and lays its vile hands on the sacred altar of\nliberty and the sacred flag of the country, and would\noverturn the Constitution itself, thenceforth slavery\nhas no longer any constitutional rights. It is by its\nown act an outlaw. It can never come back again\ninto the temple, and claim a place by right among\nthe worshippers of truth and liberty.

It is not so. So far from this,\nslavery is the very heart and head of this whole\nstruggle. The conflict is between freedom on the\none hand, maintaining its rights, and slavery on the\nother, usurping and demanding that to which it has\nno right. It is a war of principle as well as of self-\npreservation; and that is but a miserable and short-\nsighted policy which looks merely at the danger, and\noverlooks the cause; which seeks merely to put out\nthe fire, and lets the incendiary go at large, to re-\npeat the experiment at his leisure.

                    "ocr_text": "up\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE SLAVES\nEMANCIPATED BY WAR?\nThe popular instinct, which goes right to the trut\nof the matter, says, \u201c Slavery made the war; let i\ntake the consequences of war.\u201d We expect tha\nnothing more just than that could be proclaimed\nfrom Sinai itself. But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

Some sacrifices of\nnominal and pretended property, and of unworthy\nprejudices, must indeed be made ; and let these be\n;\nbalanced by the unspeakable advantages to be reap-\ned, and the unrequitable though just claims on the\nother side.

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

                    "ocr_text": "IMPORTANT CORRECTION.\nI am happy to find by the following letter,\nthat Mr Ladd, in the most obnoxious portion of\nhis speech, delivered at the annual meeting of the\nColonization Society, used the logic of slavehold-\ners and not his own. Several gentlemen who\nwere present on that occasion, drew inferences\nfrom Mr L's remarks similar to my own. After\nstating the argument of southern men-stealers,\nrelative to teaching the slaves to read the bible,\nhe added, if my memory be accurate,- Now,\nMr President, I, for one, am not prepared to wit-\nness this state of things.' The meaning of this\ndeclaration I construed as follows: \u201cAs a lover\nof peace, Mr President, and a discourager of ser-\nvile insurrections, I am not prepared to see the\nslaves possess that knowledge which alone is\nwanting to induce them to perpetrate acts of tar-\nbarity and retaliation, at which humanity must\nshudder.' Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

It will\nbe recollected that in his challenge to Anti-Colo-\nnizationists, Mr Orr prescribed the same terms\n(with a trifling exception) as did the Shade of\nAshmun. This circumstance induced me to think\nthat Mr Orr was the Shade of Ashraun.\nWe are likewise reminded that my attack on\nMr 0. was published in the N. Y. Sentinel, a\npaper which was not included in the conditions\nstipulated by the Shade of Ashmun.' Very well.\nI did not address the Shade of Ashmun, nor did\nI contemplate holding the controversy with him ;\non the contrary, it was expressly understood that\nthe controversy, on his part, was to be relinquish-\ned, unless he should consent to comply with my\nrequisitions. The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility! What cunning geniuses coloniza-\ntionists are !!\nThis is no time to cavil; the subject of Colo-\nnization is too weighty to be trifled with.\nDo I now challenge the Rev. Isaac Orr to\ndiscuss the merits of the American Colonization\nSociety with me upon the following terms : Mr\nOrr shall reply to the article aldressed to him\npublished in the N. Y. Sentinel of Dec. 24. The\narticles of the controversy shall be published in\nthe American Spectator, shall be alternato, and\noccupy an equal proportion of space. A copy of\nthe papers, containing said articles, to be directed\nto me in this city.\nWe shall now have an opportunity to test Mr\nOrr's courage and sincerity.'\nGARDNER JONES.\nNew-York, March 7th, 1832.\n'my",

What must be the constituents of\nsuch a representative?\nMr. Speaker, I am almost afraid to trust myseli\non this subject ; but representing a free people, i\nought to speak as I know they would speak, were\nthey personally present, and I know they would fling\ndefiance in your very teeth on this subject. To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance. I war gentlemen what they do. The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

His perso\nis good, his manner free and graceful, and his\naccent peculiar, such as marks the Indian fron\nthe white man. His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion. A per-\nson standing near him caught his coat to hold\nhim, but as the order was given to fire he made a\nspring, broke loose from the hold, and was before\nthe nouth of the gun just as it went off. His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together. The\nupper part, consisting of the head, arms, and\nbreast, was thrown thirty or forty feet in the air,\nand struck the ground about thirty feet from the\nother portion.\nWorthy of notice. The fine ship Alert, be-\nlonging to Messrs. Perkins & Co. of Boston, com-\nmanded by James W. Seaver, Esq. of Kingston,\nMass. recently arrived here from Canton, has per-\nformed her voyage from Boston to Europe, from\nthence to Canton and back, in the unprecedented\ntime of nine months and twenty days, having de-\nlivered and received four full cargoes in her ab-\nsence, during which time not a drop of ardent\nspirits has been used by the officers and crew, or\nby any visitor on board, having left the country\nwithout any of any description, except a small\nquantity of eau de vie,' as a medicine, for which,\nfrom their continual good health during the voy-\nage, they found no necessity to call to their aid.\n- Journal of Commerce.\nCincinnati, Feb. 29.-Every day brings us,\nand every day shows us, further ravages of this\ngreat and sweeping calamity. A gentleman of\nunquestionable veracity informs us that in one\nhundred miles distance, above the mouth of Cum-\nberland, he counted sixty-nine houses afloat on\nthe Ohio in a single day, between sunrise and\nsunset. Lawrenceburg, only about twenty miles\nbelow us, we are informed, was so completely\ninundated, that not a family was left in the place,\nall having fled to the high ground in the neigh-\nborhood, and in that distressed situation, compel-\nled to abide the peltings of the pitiless storm,'\nand endure the severe cold which followed it.\nWe learn from good authority, that the late\nrise exceeded that of 1793 by three feet six inch-\nes, and that of 1815 by five feet ten inches.

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW. C. RAYMOND, { Committee.\nH. T. BARTLETT,\nR. G. LATTING, Sec. 9th Dist.\nB. K. HOWELL, ? Committee.",

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

                    "ocr_text": "LETTER FROM HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\nTo the Editors of the N. Y. Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

                    "ocr_text": "a\nLet us recall briefly to our English readers what\nthis war really is. And in the first place, let us\nlave done, once and forever, with the talk about its\nbeing a war of rival tariffs.\nProtection and Free Trade have nothing to do\nwith it. The Protective System originated with\nthe South. Every tariff has passed by Southern\nvotes. There has been no session in which the\nSouth and the (so-called) Free-Trade Democracy\nof the North could not have controlled the legisla-\ntion of Congress. More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

Whence\ncomes the necessity for this uprising of the people ?\nTo these questions, there can be but one answer.\nSLAVERY HAS DONE IT. That accursed system,\nwhich has already cost us so much, has at length cul-\nminated in this present ruin and confusion. That\nsystem must be put down. The danger must never\nbe suffered to occur again. The evil must be eradi-\ncated, cost what it may.

The conflict is between freedom on the\none hand, maintaining its rights, and slavery on the\nother, usurping and demanding that to which it has\nno right.

                    "ocr_text": "up\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE SLAVES\nEMANCIPATED BY WAR?\nThe popular instinct, which goes right to the trut\nof the matter, says, \u201c Slavery made the war; let i\ntake the consequences of war.\u201d We expect tha\nnothing more just than that could be proclaimed\nfrom Sinai itself. But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

In the na-\nture of the case, it can only be for the traitors that\nwe have assumed the duties of slave-driver and\nslaye-catcher-a business regarded as degraded by\nthe slaveholders themselves, but which our brave\nvolunteers, who have offered life, fortune and honor\nin the service of their country, are called upon to\ncarry on for the very men who are fighting against\nthem with all the resorts of the assassin.\nThe rebels boasted from the outbreak of the re-\nbellion, that they could carry on the war without\nexhaustion, for their slaves would do the agricul-\ntural labor while the whites did the fighting. It is\nhardly probable that they expected the government\nto assist them in carrying this out; but our North-\nern men who have left their fields and shops to de-\nfend the government, or who have been cut off from\nlabor by the war, are informed that their first duty\nis to keep\nthe slaves of the rebels at work, while\ntheir masters are carrying on the war.\nNo war can\nbe carried on successfully which begin\nsition so demoralizing to the troops. coellion\ncan ever be suppressed which the government first\nsets up as more sacred than itself; nor ought a re-\nbellion to be conquered by a government which\nrecognizes it as sacred.\nIf our government intends to carry on the war,\nit is high time for it to assume belligerent rights.\nSo far, it has been done as if the Jeff. Davis insur-\nrection had the divine right of government, and we\nwere the rebels. They plunder our citizens, lynch\nand murder them, and we hasten to turn the other\ncheek by offering to keep the negro property in\nsubjection. They forbid our men-of-war to enter\nPensacola harbor, and the men-of-war meekly take\npost outside, and for months witness the passage in\nand out of vessels laden with supplies for the rebel\ntroops. Their privateers steal out of their ports,\nand capture our merchant vessels, while our ships-\nof-war have at length become so bold as to turn\nback vessels laden with supplies for Bragg's troops,\nand forbid them to enter. At the last accounts, an\nUnited States officer tried hard to induce a rebel\ncaptain, who had been stopped with a cargo of lum-\nber, to sell it at an exorbitant price to the govern-\nment, for the troops on Santa Rosas Island; but he\nrefused, and was turned back with his cargo.\nA guerrilla war is waged on our outposts in Vir-\nginia, and our sentinels stolen upon in the darkness\nand shot down. Sometimes the assassin is taken.\nThen he becomes a prisoner of war, and in due\ntime is exchanged, or disemon tali the oath\nof allegiance, to go on shooting our sentino..\nBy the principle of war, every individual of the\nhostile people is at war, and is responsible in life\nand property. Modern Warfare has, to some ex-\ntent, ameliorated this by sparing private property,\nand the persons of those not actually combatant.\nBut this is conceded only on the ground that the\nhostile inhabitants are peaceable, and do not molest\nthe troops. If they do, they are liable to every\npenalty of war, both in person and property, and\nwar does not admit of nice discriminations.\nThe guerrilla assassination of our troops every-\nwhere in Virginia would justify, according to the\nmost humane rules of war, the severest retaliation\nupon the inhabitants and their property. But the\nmore they shoot our pickets, the more we strive to\nshow our regard for the sanctity of their persons\nand property; and the severest penalties are in-\nflicted on the soldiers of the government who have\nexercised a soldier's right to plunder armed ene-\nmies,\nThe result of this course is seen in Virginia and\neverywhere in the infected districts. Rebellion is\nthe safest business now carried on in the country.\nIts consequences are a farce - a mere joke-an\noath. What can be a richer joke to a Southern\nrebel than an oath of allegiance ? Our army holds\nno more ground than its bayonets cover. Pickets of\nthe rebels everywhere surround it with impunity,\ncutting it off from intelligence, building batteries\nunder its very guns, setting ambushes, and amusing\nthemselves by picking off our sentinels. If they\nare taken, it ends as a joke.\nOur President proclaims that rebel privateers will\nbe treated as pirates, and we growl at England be-\ncause she does not proclaim the same. But a rebel\nprivateer is taken, and her crew, instead of being\nsuspended at once to the yard-arm, are brought to\nNew York to take advantage of the law's delay,\nand the glorious right of trial by jury, with the\nchance of aid from some judicial traitor, by one of\nwhom the Administration has already been cowed.\nFrom the Atlantic to the Mississippi, supplies are\ncontinually transported from the North to the rebel\narmy, and the government resorts to no efficient\nmeasures to prevent; but, on the other hand, is\nquoted by conditional rebels as indorsing a neu-\ntrality which is protecting and supplying the rebel\narmy, and doing more to aid it and destroy the gov-\nernment, than could be done by its active hostility.\nThe war has never yet been recognized as an\nexisting fact, by our side. We have endured every\nact of war as if it was a right which belonged to\nthe rebels. It may be that nothing but some serious\ndisaster to our cause will establish just distinctions,\nand force us to the exercise of belligerent rights.\nBut if we have not a right to crush this rebellion as\na crime, and to hang the ringleaders as traitors, we\nhave no right to resort to force at all. If they have\nthe right to make war upon the government, and\nare nothing but prisoners of war when taken, then\ntheir independent rights are conceded, and we have\nno right to carry on the war on our part. The\npresent treatment does nothing but strengthen und\nextend the rebellion. Until our forces treat the\nrebellion as treason, and resort to every belligerent\nright to cripple its power and crush it into submis-\nsion by every penalty of war, we shall make no\nprogress against it.-Cincinnati Gazette.\na\nWASHINGTON, June 11th.\nThree slaves were\ntaken into one of the camps yesterday. A Mr.\nWebb, of Virginia, claimed to be their owner, and\ndemanded them. The Colonel refused, deeming\nthem contraband.

In the na-\nture of the case, it can only be for the traitors that\nwe have assumed the duties of slave-driver and\nslaye-catcher-a business regarded as degraded by\nthe slaveholders themselves, but which our brave\nvolunteers, who have offered life, fortune and honor\nin the service of their country, are called upon to\ncarry on for the very men who are fighting against\nthem with all the resorts of the assassin.\nThe rebels boasted from the outbreak of the re-\nbellion, that they could carry on the war without\nexhaustion, for their slaves would do the agricul-\ntural labor while the whites did the fighting. It is\nhardly probable that they expected the government\nto assist them in carrying this out; but our North-\nern men who have left their fields and shops to de-\nfend the government, or who have been cut off from\nlabor by the war, are informed that their first duty\nis to keep the slaves of the rebels at work, while\ntheir masters are carrying on the war.\nNo war can\nbe carried on successfully which begin\nsition so demoralizing to the troops. ellion\ncan ever be suppressed which the government first\nsets up as more sacred than itself; nor ought a re-\nbellion to be conquered by a government which\nrecognizes it as sacred.\nIf our government intends to carry on the war,\nit is high time for it to assume belligerent rights.\nSo far, it has been done as if the Jeff. Davis insur-\nrection had the divine right of government, and we\nwere the rebels. They plunder our citizens, lynch\nand murder them, and we hasten to turn the other\ncheek by offering to keep the negro property in\nsubjection. They forbid our men-of-war to enter\nPensacola harbor, and the men-of-war meekly take\npost outside, and for months witness the passage in\nand out of vessels laden with supplies for the rebel\ntroops. Their privateers steal out of their ports,\nand capture our merchant vessels, while our ships-\nof-war have at length become so bold as to turn\nback vessels laden with supplies for Bragg's troops,\nand forbid them to enter. At the last accounts, an\nUnited States officer tried hard to induce a rebel\ncaptain, who had been stopped with a cargo of lum-\nber, to sell it at an exorbitant price to the govern-\nment, for the troops on Santa Rosas Island; but he\nrefused, and was turned back with his cargo.\nA guerrilla war is waged on our outposts in Vir-\nginia, and our sentinels stolen upon in the darkness\nand shot down. Sometimes the assassin is taken.\nThen he becomes a prisoner of war, and in due\ntime is exchanged, or disemon tali the oath\nof allegiance, to go on shooting our sentimosain.\nBy the principle of war, every individual of the\nhostile people is at war, and is responsible in life\nand property. Modern Warfare has, to some ex-\ntent, ameliorated this by sparing private property,\nand the persons of those not actually combatant.\nBut this is conceded only on the ground that the\nhostile inhabitants are peaceable, and do not molest\nthe troops. If they do, they are liable to every\npenalty of war, both in person and property, and\nwar does not admit of nice discriminations.\nThe guerrilla assassination of our troops every-\nwhere in Virginia would justify, according to the\nmost humane rules of war, the severest retaliation\nupon the inhabitants and their property. But the\nmore they shoot our pickets, the more we strive to\nshow our regard for the sanctity of their persons\nand property; and the severest penalties are in-\nflicted on the soldiers of the government who have\nexercised a soldier's right to plunder armed ene-\nmies,\nThe result of this course is seen in Virginia and\neverywhere in the infected districts. Rebellion is\nthe safest business now carried on in the country.\nIts consequences are a farce - a mere joke-an\noath. What can be a richer joke to a Southern\nrebel than an oath of allegiance ? Our army holds\nno more ground than its bayonets cover. Pickets of\nthe rebels everywhere surround it with impunity,\ncutting it off from intelligence, building batteries\nunder its very guns, setting ambushes, and amusing\nthemselves by picking off our sentinels. If they\nare taken, it ends as a joke.\nOur President proclaims that rebel privateers will\nbe treated as pirates, and we growl at England be-\ncause she does not proclaim the same. But a rebel\nprivateer is taken, and her crew, instead of being\nsuspended at once to the yard-arm, are brought to\nNew York to take advantage of the law's delay,\nand the glorious right of trial by jury, with the\nchance of aid from some judicial traitor, by one of\nwhom the Administration has already been cowed.\nFrom the Atlantic to the Mississippi, supplies are\ncontinually transported from the North to the rebel\narmy, and the government resorts to no efficient\nmeasures to prevent; but, on the other hand, is\nquoted by conditional rebels as indorsing a neu-\ntrality which is protecting and supplying the rebel\narmy, and doing more to aid it and destroy the gov-\nernment, than could be done by its active hostility.\nThe war has never yet been recognized as an\nexisting fact, by our side. We have endured every\nact of war as if it was a right which belonged to\nthe rebels. It may be that nothing but some serious\ndisaster to our cause will establish just distinctions,\nand force us to the exercise of belligerent rights.\nBut if we have not a right to crush this rebellion as\na crime, and to hang the ringleaders as traitors, we\nhave no right to resort to force at all. If they have\nthe right to make war upon the government, and\nare nothing but prisoners of war when taken, then\ntheir independent rights are conceded, and we have\nno right to carry on the war on our part. The\npresent treatment does nothing but strengthen und\nextend the rebellion. Until our forces treat the\nrebellion as treason, and resort to every belligerent\nright to cripple its power and crush it into submis-\nsion by every penalty of war, we shall make no\nprogress against it.--Cincinnati Gazette.\na\nWASHINGTON, June 11th.\nThree slaves were\ntaken into one of the camps yesterday. A Mr.\nWebb, of Virginia, claimed to be their owner, and\ndemanded them. The Colonel refused, deeming\nthem contraband. They were sent over to General\nSandford's quarters, upon his order, where Webb\nagain presented himself, and General Sandford sent\nfor a wagon at his own expense, into which the three\nnegroes were placed, and sent back to Virginia, to\nthe entire satisfaction of their secession master. This\nact on General Sandford's part has given rise to\nmuch comment to-day, and he gets very little credit\nin any quarter, save among the rebel slave-owners\nover the river.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

D. 1832.\nThat on Wednesday evening, the 29th day of Feb-\nruary last, he left the house of Thomas Porter, in\nVine street, No. 54, between the hours of 6 and 7\no'clock in the evening ; that he was about turning\ninto Coates alley, not quite a square from Mr. Por-\nter's house, when he was seized by two nien; that\nthey put a plaister over his mouth and held both bis\nhands, and took bim down Front street to Market\nstreet, and then put him on board a sloop at the\nlower side of Market street whar\u017f; that they put\nhim down into the hold of ihe sloop, took the plais-\nter from his mouth, and told him if he made a noise\nor hallooed they would knock out his brains; that\nthey pushed off the sloop immediately and went\ndown the river ; that they arrived at Delaware City\nabout 12 o'clock at night ; that there was a black\nman in the hold with him ; that the sloop was made\n3\nfast to the wharf, and he heard the men say that they\nwould go to the tavern and get something to drink ;\nthat after the men had gone, this deponent and the\nblack nan broke open the hatchway and came on\ndeck, got upon the wharf and ran off as fast as they\ncould ; that about 3 o'clock on the morning of Fri-\nday they got to Wilmington, and that they both\ncame to the city on Friday in the Wilmington stean-\nboat. That while on board the sloop he heard the\nsay,\n. we have got these two fellows tight e-\nnough.' That the black man told deponent he lived\nin Shippen street, and had there a wife and three\nchildren ; that the black man told him he was\nbrought to the sloop in the same way that the depo-\nnent was brought there ; that on the way from Del-\naware City they stopped at a house where some\ncolored people lived, and stayed there some hours ;\nthat they were travelling all day on Thursday. That\nthe men who took .bm had on black dresses and\nchecked shirts ; that they had on long coats and\nblack hats ; that when they put him into the hold\nthey took off the plaister from his mouth; that he\nobserved nothing in the hold of the vessel ; that\nthey had no light ; that when himself and the black\nman made their escape, he first knew his companion\nto be black ; that the black man did not tell his\nname.\nJAMES C.

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

Several gentlemen who\nwere present on that occasion, drew inferences\nfrom Mr L's remarks similar to my own. After\nstating the argument of southern men-stealers,\nrelative to teaching the slaves to read the bible,\nhe added, if my memory be accurate,- Now,\nMr President, I, for one, am not prepared to wit-\nness this state of things.' The meaning of this\ndeclaration I construed as follows: \u201cAs a lover\nof peace, Mr President, and a discourager of ser-\nvile insurrections, I am not prepared to see the\nslaves possess that knowledge which alone is\nwanting to induce them to perpetrate acts of tar-\nbarity and retaliation, at which humanity must\nshudder.' Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility!

What must be the constituents of\nsuch a representative?\nMr. Speaker, I am almost afraid to trust myseli\non this subject ; but representing a free people, i\nought to speak as I know they would speak, were\nthey personally present, and I know they would fling\ndefiance in your very teeth on this subject. To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance. I war gentlemen what they do. The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

                    "ocr_text": "It was\nonce\nFrom the Daily Advocate.\nSpeech of John Ridge,\nA CHEROKEE CHIEF,\nAt a meeting in the Old South Church, March 7\nMr. RIDGE, the senior delegate from the Che\nrokee nation, rose to address the audience, and\nwas greeted with great applause. His perso\nis good, his manner free and graceful, and his\naccent peculiar, such as marks the Indian fron\nthe white man. His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

As all the illegitimate sons of the King by Mrs\nJordan have been, or are to be advanced to the\npeerage, the children of the Duke of Sussex, by La-\ndy Augusta Murray, are setting up their claims also.\nCholera.-While this disease was dying away\nin the quarter where it first broke out, and was con-\nfined for some time within a comparatively small\ncircuit, it was extending its ravages northward, and\nthere was no average diminution of the number of\ncases reported. Total number of cases up to 230,\n2377 ; deaths, 801.\nLe Temps says-A report was current on Satur-\nday night, that the Emperor Nicholas had been up-\nset and dangerously hurt during a pleasure excursion\non a sledge. It was added, that the person who\naccompanied his majesty, was killed on the spot.\nLetters from Gibraltar announce the death of\nGen. Don, late Governor of that garrison. He died\nof an influenza and a severe cough, which has\nproved futal to every person whom it has yet at-\ntacked.\nThe Emperor of Russia was about to visit the\nPrussian capital. One account states that he had\nactually taken his departure from St Petersburgh.\nUpon this subject, the Courier says: We leave it to\npoliticians to speculate upon the motives of his jour-\nney; but it must be something very important to\ninduce the Emperor to quit St Petersburgh at this sea-\nson of the year.\nAmong the fashions prevailing just now at Paris,\nis that of wearing ten breadths in the skirt of the\ndress. In one of Jouy's papers, in L'Hermite de\nla Chausse d'Antin,' he makes the old lady declare\nthat the brocade of her wedding suit was alierwards\nmade into covers for a sofa and a dozen arm chairs,\nand it seems likely that so curious an epoch of fash-\nion will be renewed.\nExtraordinary Wager.-Mr Udny, the vener-\nable Postmaster of Lisniere, Bedfordshire, undertook,\nfor a wager, to travel from that town to Latmore, in\nan oyster barrel, drawn by a pig, a badger, two\ncats, a goose and a hedgehog. His head was dec-\norated with a red night-cap, and he drove with a\npig-driver's whip. He is in his 97th year.\nThe gigantic Book.-We translate the follow-\ning paragraph froni Le Globe, of the 19th ult.\n\u2022 The largest book that ever went to press, will ap-\npear next year in London. It will be entitled \" The\nPantheon of English Heroes.\u201d Every page will be\ntwenty-four feet high by twelve broad, and the let-\nters hall a foot long. It has been necessary to con-\nstruct a machine for the fabrication of the paper.\nThis gigantic work will be printed by means of a\nsteam engine, and, instead of black ink, gold var-\nnish will be used. Only one hundred copies will\nbe struck off, intended as the ornaments of the prin-\ncipal English libraries.'-Literury Gazeite.\n6",

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion. A per-\nson standing near him caught his coat to hold\nhim, but as the order was given to fire he made a\nspring, broke loose from the hold, and was before\nthe nouth of the gun just as it went off. His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together. The\nupper part, consisting of the head, arms, and\nbreast, was thrown thirty or forty feet in the air,\nand struck the ground about thirty feet from the\nother portion.\nWorthy of notice.

Between the first day of May and the\nfirst of November last, there were laid more than e-\nleven hundred thousand bricks, and during the whole\ntime (say the state coinmissioners) not an accident\nhappened on the work, not an hour's time had been\nlost by any of the workmen on account of indisposi-\ntion, and not a drop of urdent spirits had been\nconsumed in the performance.\nThe Drunkard's Thirst - The Temperance\nRecord gives an account of a drunkard, whom his\nfriends were obliged to put in a strait jacket to pre-\nvent his making way with himself. In this condi-\ntion, having found sixpence somewhere about the\nhouse, he lifted it up with his mouth, opened three\ndoors with his teeth, and proceeded to a grog shop,\nwhere he laid out his money in whiskey, which the\nperson who sold it, held to his mouth till he had\ndrunk it.\nThere is a jewel which no Indian mine can buy,\nNo chenic art can counterfeit ;\nIt makes men rich in greatest poverty,\nMakes water wine, turns wooden cups to gold,\nThe homely whistle to sweet music's strain ;\nSeldom it coines, lo few from Heaven sent,\nThat much in little--all in nought-Content.\n[Wilbye's Madrigals.\nExtracts from a Modern Dictionary.\u2014Law-\nyer-A learned gentleman who rescues your estate\nfrom\nyour enemy, and keeps it himself. Dentist-\nA person who finds work for his own teeth by tak-\ning out those of other people. Watchmal-A man\nemployed by the corporation to sleep in the open.\nair.\nMurder.-We understand, says the Bridgeport\npaper, that a young man named Barnum, about\n17 years of age, killed his father last week in\nDanbury, Kings street, by shooting him. It is\nsaid that the son had been hired out by his fath-\ner, who took the wages, which caused such re-\nsentment in the son that he deliberately loaded\nhis gun and shot his father while sitting by the fire.\nSpiced Fish.-It is a curious fact, that since the\nbrig Java was stranded on Cape Cod, near Nauset\nharbor, Cod fish have been more abundant near the\nshore than was ever known previous to that even!.\nWe are informed, on credible authority, that from\nthe fish caught from a small row boat in one day,\nnearly half a bushel of nutmegs, besides a quantity\nof coflee, was taken.\nOne fish, a real screamer,' had no less than fif-\nteen nutmegs in his clain basket, and others nearly\nas many. There must be terrible goings on' down\nbelow; we should not wonder if they were about to\ncelebrate a centennial anniversary on the Grand\nBanks, and that these sea-foragers were the pur-\nveyors.-- Transcript.",

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW. C. RAYMOND, { Committee.\nH. T. BARTLETT,\nR. G. LATTING, Sec. 9th Dist.\nB. K. HOWELL, ? Committee.",

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

                    "ocr_text": "CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ENGLISH PRESS.\nBY CHARLES L. BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

                    "ocr_text": "a\nLet us recall briefly to our English readers what\nthis war really is. And in the first place, let us\nlave done, once and forever, with the talk about its\nbeing a war of rival tariffs.\nProtection and Free Trade have nothing to do\nwith it. The Protective System originated with\nthe South. Every tariff has passed by Southern\nvotes. There has been no session in which the\nSouth and the (so-called) Free-Trade Democracy\nof the North could not have controlled the legisla-\ntion of Congress. More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

                    "ocr_text": "IMPORTANT CORRECTION.\nI am happy to find by the following letter,\nthat Mr Ladd, in the most obnoxious portion of\nhis speech, delivered at the annual meeting of the\nColonization Society, used the logic of slavehold-\ners and not his own. Several gentlemen who\nwere present on that occasion, drew inferences\nfrom Mr L's remarks similar to my own. After\nstating the argument of southern men-stealers,\nrelative to teaching the slaves to read the bible,\nhe added, if my memory be accurate,- Now,\nMr President, I, for one, am not prepared to wit-\nness this state of things.' The meaning of this\ndeclaration I construed as follows: \u201cAs a lover\nof peace, Mr President, and a discourager of ser-\nvile insurrections, I am not prepared to see the\nslaves possess that knowledge which alone is\nwanting to induce them to perpetrate acts of tar-\nbarity and retaliation, at which humanity must\nshudder.' Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We have no right to\nkeep our fellow-creatures in bondage a single\nminute ; though I must confess that great dilli-\nculty attends the question of immediate emanci-\npation.\nThough I am in favor of emancipation, I tvould\nI\nattempt it by those means only which Christ has\nsanctioned. We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

It will\nbe recollected that in his challenge to Anti-Colo-\nnizationists, Mr Orr prescribed the same terms\n(with a trifling exception) as did the Shade of\nAshmun. This circumstance induced me to think\nthat Mr Orr was the Shade of Ashraun.\nWe are likewise reminded that my attack on\nMr 0. was published in the N. Y. Sentinel, a\npaper which was not included in the conditions\nstipulated by the Shade of Ashmun.' Very well.\nI did not address the Shade of Ashmun, nor did\nI contemplate holding the controversy with him ;\non the contrary, it was expressly understood that\nthe controversy, on his part, was to be relinquish-\ned, unless he should consent to comply with my\nrequisitions. The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility! What cunning geniuses coloniza-\ntionists are !!\nThis is no time to cavil; the subject of Colo-\nnization is too weighty to be trifled with.\nDo I now challenge the Rev. Isaac Orr to\ndiscuss the merits of the American Colonization\nSociety with me upon the following terms : Mr\nOrr shall reply to the article aldressed to him\npublished in the N. Y. Sentinel of Dec. 24. The\narticles of the controversy shall be published in\nthe American Spectator, shall be alternato, and\noccupy an equal proportion of space. A copy of\nthe papers, containing said articles, to be directed\nto me in this city.\nWe shall now have an opportunity to test Mr\nOrr's courage and sincerity.'\nGARDNER JONES.\nNew-York, March 7th, 1832.\n'my",

To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance.

The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

                    "ocr_text": "It was\nonce\nFrom the Daily Advocate.\nSpeech of John Ridge,\nA CHEROKEE CHIEF,\nAt a meeting in the Old South Church, March 7\nMr. RIDGE, the senior delegate from the Che\nrokee nation, rose to address the audience, and\nwas greeted with great applause. His perso\nis good, his manner free and graceful, and his\naccent peculiar, such as marks the Indian fron\nthe white man. His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

As all the illegitimate sons of the King by Mrs\nJordan have been, or are to be advanced to the\npeerage, the children of the Duke of Sussex, by La-\ndy Augusta Murray, are setting up their claims also.\nCholera.-While this disease was dying away\nin the quarter where it first broke out, and was con-\nfined for some time within a comparatively small\ncircuit, it was extending its ravages northward, and\nthere was no average diminution of the number of\ncases reported. Total number of cases up to 230,\n2377 ; deaths, 801.\nLe Temps says-A report was current on Satur-\nday night, that the Emperor Nicholas had been up-\nset and dangerously hurt during a pleasure excursion\non a sledge. It was added, that the person who\naccompanied his majesty, was killed on the spot.\nLetters from Gibraltar announce the death of\nGen. Don, late Governor of that garrison. He died\nof an influenza and a severe cough, which has\nproved futal to every person whom it has yet at-\ntacked.\nThe Emperor of Russia was about to visit the\nPrussian capital. One account states that he had\nactually taken his departure from St Petersburgh.\nUpon this subject, the Courier says: We leave it to\npoliticians to speculate upon the motives of his jour-\nney; but it must be something very important to\ninduce the Emperor to quit St Petersburgh at this sea-\nson of the year.\nAmong the fashions prevailing just now at Paris,\nis that of wearing ten breadths in the skirt of the\ndress. In one of Jouy's papers, in L'Hermite de\nla Chausse d'Antin,' he makes the old lady declare\nthat the brocade of her wedding suit was alierwards\nmade into covers for a sofa and a dozen arm chairs,\nand it seems likely that so curious an epoch of fash-\nion will be renewed.\nExtraordinary Wager.-Mr Udny, the vener-\nable Postmaster of Lisniere, Bedfordshire, undertook,\nfor a wager, to travel from that town to Latmore, in\nan oyster barrel, drawn by a pig, a badger, two\ncats, a goose and a hedgehog. His head was dec-\norated with a red night-cap, and he drove with a\npig-driver's whip. He is in his 97th year.\nThe gigantic Book.-We translate the follow-\ning paragraph froni Le Globe, of the 19th ult.\n\u2022 The largest book that ever went to press, will ap-\npear next year in London. It will be entitled \" The\nPantheon of English Heroes.\u201d Every page will be\ntwenty-four feet high by twelve broad, and the let-\nters hall a foot long. It has been necessary to con-\nstruct a machine for the fabrication of the paper.\nThis gigantic work will be printed by means of a\nsteam engine, and, instead of black ink, gold var-\nnish will be used. Only one hundred copies will\nbe struck off, intended as the ornaments of the prin-\ncipal English libraries.'-Literury Gazeite.\n6",

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion. A per-\nson standing near him caught his coat to hold\nhim, but as the order was given to fire he made a\nspring, broke loose from the hold, and was before\nthe nouth of the gun just as it went off. His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together.

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW.

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

                    "ocr_text": "LETTER FROM HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\nTo the Editors of the N. Y. Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

                    "ocr_text": "CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ENGLISH PRESS.\nBY CHARLES L. BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

                    "ocr_text": "up\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE SLAVES\nEMANCIPATED BY WAR?\nThe popular instinct, which goes right to the trut\nof the matter, says, \u201c Slavery made the war; let i\ntake the consequences of war.\u201d We expect tha\nnothing more just than that could be proclaimed\nfrom Sinai itself. But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

                    "ocr_text": "IMPORTANT CORRECTION.\nI am happy to find by the following letter,\nthat Mr Ladd, in the most obnoxious portion of\nhis speech, delivered at the annual meeting of the\nColonization Society, used the logic of slavehold-\ners and not his own. Several gentlemen who\nwere present on that occasion, drew inferences\nfrom Mr L's remarks similar to my own. After\nstating the argument of southern men-stealers,\nrelative to teaching the slaves to read the bible,\nhe added, if my memory be accurate,- Now,\nMr President, I, for one, am not prepared to wit-\nness this state of things.' The meaning of this\ndeclaration I construed as follows: \u201cAs a lover\nof peace, Mr President, and a discourager of ser-\nvile insurrections, I am not prepared to see the\nslaves possess that knowledge which alone is\nwanting to induce them to perpetrate acts of tar-\nbarity and retaliation, at which humanity must\nshudder.' Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We have no right to\nkeep our fellow-creatures in bondage a single\nminute ; though I must confess that great dilli-\nculty attends the question of immediate emanci-\npation.\nThough I am in favor of emancipation, I tvould\nI\nattempt it by those means only which Christ has\nsanctioned. We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

It will\nbe recollected that in his challenge to Anti-Colo-\nnizationists, Mr Orr prescribed the same terms\n(with a trifling exception) as did the Shade of\nAshmun. This circumstance induced me to think\nthat Mr Orr was the Shade of Ashraun.\nWe are likewise reminded that my attack on\nMr 0. was published in the N. Y. Sentinel, a\npaper which was not included in the conditions\nstipulated by the Shade of Ashmun.' Very well.\nI did not address the Shade of Ashmun, nor did\nI contemplate holding the controversy with him ;\non the contrary, it was expressly understood that\nthe controversy, on his part, was to be relinquish-\ned, unless he should consent to comply with my\nrequisitions. The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility! What cunning geniuses coloniza-\ntionists are !!\nThis is no time to cavil; the subject of Colo-\nnization is too weighty to be trifled with.\nDo I now challenge the Rev. Isaac Orr to\ndiscuss the merits of the American Colonization\nSociety with me upon the following terms : Mr\nOrr shall reply to the article aldressed to him\npublished in the N. Y. Sentinel of Dec. 24. The\narticles of the controversy shall be published in\nthe American Spectator, shall be alternato, and\noccupy an equal proportion of space. A copy of\nthe papers, containing said articles, to be directed\nto me in this city.\nWe shall now have an opportunity to test Mr\nOrr's courage and sincerity.'\nGARDNER JONES.\nNew-York, March 7th, 1832.\n'my",

What must be the constituents of\nsuch a representative?\nMr. Speaker, I am almost afraid to trust myseli\non this subject ; but representing a free people, i\nought to speak as I know they would speak, were\nthey personally present, and I know they would fling\ndefiance in your very teeth on this subject. To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance. I war gentlemen what they do. The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

We commend her \u00b7 Med-\nitations,' which partake largely of a devotional\nspirit, to the patronage of the people of color, and\nof all those among the whites who are disposed\nto encourage genius and piety in a person of her\ncomplexion. Some errors occurred in printing\nthe work, which an intelligent reader will detect,\nand for which the printers are responsible.\nTHE PROTESTANT_New-York City--edited\nby the Rev. George Bourne. Ifa righteous cause,\nsuperior talents, tireless industry and extraordinary\nmoral courage deserve encourageinent, then \"The\nProtestant' presents a claim to public patronage i ot\nsurpassed by any other pablication in this country.\nWe are sorry to learn, however, that its support is\nfar from being efficient ; and the fact is traly mar-\nvellous in our eyes. The people of color, as far as\ntheir means allow, ought for peculiar reasons to pat-\nronise this grand \u00b7 Espositor of Popery.\" Mr. Bourne\nis one of their ablest champions, and has suffered\ngreat privations in their cause. Seventeen years ago\nhe published a work, entitled . The Book [the Bi-\nble] and Slavery Irriconcilable,' which, from\nthat time down to the present, has subjected him to\nthe relentless persecution of men-stealers and their\nfriends. Next to the bible, we are indeb:ed to this\nwork for our views of the system of slavery. We\npronounce it the most faithful and conclusive expo-\nsition of the cruelty and sin of holding the slaves in\nbondage, that we have ever scen. The more we\nread it, the higher does our admiration of its author\nrise. It ought to be in the hands of every friend,---\nay, and of every enemy, to the colored population.\nWe are happy to learn that a new edition of it, re-\nvised and corrected, will probably be issued in a\nshort time ; and we cannot doubt that its sale will\nbc rapid.",

His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

As all the illegitimate sons of the King by Mrs\nJordan have been, or are to be advanced to the\npeerage, the children of the Duke of Sussex, by La-\ndy Augusta Murray, are setting up their claims also.\nCholera.-While this disease was dying away\nin the quarter where it first broke out, and was con-\nfined for some time within a comparatively small\ncircuit, it was extending its ravages northward, and\nthere was no average diminution of the number of\ncases reported. Total number of cases up to 230,\n2377 ; deaths, 801.\nLe Temps says-A report was current on Satur-\nday night, that the Emperor Nicholas had been up-\nset and dangerously hurt during a pleasure excursion\non a sledge. It was added, that the person who\naccompanied his majesty, was killed on the spot.\nLetters from Gibraltar announce the death of\nGen. Don, late Governor of that garrison. He died\nof an influenza and a severe cough, which has\nproved futal to every person whom it has yet at-\ntacked.\nThe Emperor of Russia was about to visit the\nPrussian capital. One account states that he had\nactually taken his departure from St Petersburgh.\nUpon this subject, the Courier says: We leave it to\npoliticians to speculate upon the motives of his jour-\nney; but it must be something very important to\ninduce the Emperor to quit St Petersburgh at this sea-\nson of the year.\nAmong the fashions prevailing just now at Paris,\nis that of wearing ten breadths in the skirt of the\ndress. In one of Jouy's papers, in L'Hermite de\nla Chausse d'Antin,' he makes the old lady declare\nthat the brocade of her wedding suit was alierwards\nmade into covers for a sofa and a dozen arm chairs,\nand it seems likely that so curious an epoch of fash-\nion will be renewed.\nExtraordinary Wager.-Mr Udny, the vener-\nable Postmaster of Lisniere, Bedfordshire, undertook,\nfor a wager, to travel from that town to Latmore, in\nan oyster barrel, drawn by a pig, a badger, two\ncats, a goose and a hedgehog. His head was dec-\norated with a red night-cap, and he drove with a\npig-driver's whip. He is in his 97th year.\nThe gigantic Book.-We translate the follow-\ning paragraph froni Le Globe, of the 19th ult.\n\u2022 The largest book that ever went to press, will ap-\npear next year in London. It will be entitled \" The\nPantheon of English Heroes.\u201d Every page will be\ntwenty-four feet high by twelve broad, and the let-\nters hall a foot long. It has been necessary to con-\nstruct a machine for the fabrication of the paper.\nThis gigantic work will be printed by means of a\nsteam engine, and, instead of black ink, gold var-\nnish will be used.

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion.

His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together.

I will relate one, the\nparticulars of which will long be impressed upon my\nmemory. The husband and wife were both the\nplay-mates of iny youth. He was once rich and re-\nspeciable, she virtuous and happy. He became re--\nduced by drunkenness, to the lowest degree of pov-\nerty and degradation, and his wife was of course\nbrought to an extreme state of wretchedness. I was\ncalled to make her a professional visit, and found\nthe husband stupid upon the floor, surrounded by\nall the disgusting accompaniments of a drunkard.\nThe poor woman lay shivering under a few tallered\nremnants of bedding ; and as I gazed upon her ema-\nciated form, I could not refrain from weeping like\na child over the innocen: victim.\nsince, so lovely, so cheerful, so happy; and now, so\nwretched. The contrast was too much. I remein-\nber well when her fond parents gave her away to\nthe man of her choice ; and I can still, as it were,\nsee her rich blue eye moistened with the sacred tear\nof affection, as she fondiy gazed upon the idol of\nher heart. That senseless, degraded being is all\nthat is left of him-und that pale and grief-worn\nforon is all that now remains of her. I remember,\ntoo, the beauiy and neatness of their first dwelling,\nwith all its tasteful decorations. It was a little Par-\nadise, of which she was the guardian angel.

A few years\nBEWARE OF A DRUNKEN HUSBAND!\nOh ! how many such heart-rending scenes have I\nbeen compelled to witness! I will relate one, the\nparticulars of which will long be impressed upon my\nmemory. The husband and wife were both the\nplay-mates of iny youth. He was once rich and re-\nspeciable, she virtuous and happy. He became re--\nduced by drunkenness, to the lowest degree of pov-\nerty and degradation, and his wife was of course\nbrought to an extreme state of wretchedness. I was\ncalled to make her a professional visit, and found\nthe husband stupid upon the floor, surrounded by\nall the disgusting accompaniments of a drunkard.\nThe poor woman lay shivering under a few tallered\nremnants of bedding ; and as I gazed upon her ema-\nciated form, I could not refrain from weeping like\na child over the innocen: victim.\nsince, so lovely, so cheerful, so happy; and now, so\nwretched. The contrast was too much. I remein-\nber well when her fond parents gave her away to\nthe man of her choice ; and I can still, as it were,\nsee her rich blue eye moistened with the sacred tear\nof affection, as she fondiy gazed upon the idol of\nher heart. That senseless, degraded being is all\nthat is left of him-und that pale and grief-worn\nforon is all that now remains of her. I remember,\ntoo, the beauiy and neatness of their first dwelling,\nwith all its tasteful decorations. It was a little Par-\nadise, of which she was the guardian angel. It was\na pleasant sight, to see the husband and wife,\non a summer evening, seated together on their pi-\nazza, enjoying sweet communion with each other,\nand revelling in unmitigated happiness. 'I heir house\nis now a wretched hovel-and their happiness, the\nbitterest dregs ever drained from the cup of human\nmisery.

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW.

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

                    "ocr_text": "LETTER FROM HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\nTo the Editors of the N. Y. Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

                    "ocr_text": "CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ENGLISH PRESS.\nBY CHARLES L. BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

                    "ocr_text": "a\nLet us recall briefly to our English readers what\nthis war really is. And in the first place, let us\nlave done, once and forever, with the talk about its\nbeing a war of rival tariffs.\nProtection and Free Trade have nothing to do\nwith it. The Protective System originated with\nthe South. Every tariff has passed by Southern\nvotes. There has been no session in which the\nSouth and the (so-called) Free-Trade Democracy\nof the North could not have controlled the legisla-\ntion of Congress. More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

Whence\ncomes the necessity for this uprising of the people ?\nTo these questions, there can be but one answer.\nSLAVERY HAS DONE IT. That accursed system,\nwhich has already cost us so much, has at length cul-\nminated in this present ruin and confusion. That\nsystem must be put down. The danger must never\nbe suffered to occur again. The evil must be eradi-\ncated, cost what it may.

                    "ocr_text": "up\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE SLAVES\nEMANCIPATED BY WAR?\nThe popular instinct, which goes right to the trut\nof the matter, says, \u201c Slavery made the war; let i\ntake the consequences of war.\u201d We expect tha\nnothing more just than that could be proclaimed\nfrom Sinai itself. But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

Our cupidity, in recently permitting an exten-\nsive domestic slave trade, has scattered throughout\nthis class the seeds of intelligence, that we can nev-\ner eradicate. Examples are multiplying around us\nof the perfect safety of liberating slaves, and of the\ncertain ultimate consequences of continuing slavery.\nCan we hesitate in our choice?\nTrained as our victims have long been in the\nschool of sorrow and of suffering, their uncomplain-\ning firmness of character and a protecting Providence\nwill yet work their redemption ; and every effort\nwe may make to bind and to crush, will be like\nraising a dam across a stream, whose waters are\ncontinually accuvulating.\nWhile we are sinking ourselves by ceaseless ef-\nforts to traduce and expel them, they are rising in\nesteem and worth, and our children's children will\nblush for our conduct.\nMy views are now before you-it will require no\nfunds to carry them into effect. Some sacrifices of\nnominal and pretended property, and of unworthy\nprejudices, must indeed be made ; and let these be\n;\nbalanced by the unspeakable advantages to be reap-\ned, and the unrequitable though just claims on the\nother side. You form a Court of Equity yourselves,\nJudges and Defendants, and have to decide on your\nown exparte evidence. The claims of your slaves\nare reduced to the simplest point. They ask\nwages for past unremunerated years of toil, though\nno Court of Equity could refuse to give them with\nout justly forfeiting its character. They ask no por-\ntion of the wealth their labors have procured you.\nThey ask only what a state of peace would give in\nall civilized nations ; that you withhold your grasp\nfrom their persons, and treat them as men.\nRAMMOHUN ROY.\nnot",

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

                    "ocr_text": "IMPORTANT CORRECTION.\nI am happy to find by the following letter,\nthat Mr Ladd, in the most obnoxious portion of\nhis speech, delivered at the annual meeting of the\nColonization Society, used the logic of slavehold-\ners and not his own. Several gentlemen who\nwere present on that occasion, drew inferences\nfrom Mr L's remarks similar to my own. After\nstating the argument of southern men-stealers,\nrelative to teaching the slaves to read the bible,\nhe added, if my memory be accurate,- Now,\nMr President, I, for one, am not prepared to wit-\nness this state of things.' The meaning of this\ndeclaration I construed as follows: \u201cAs a lover\nof peace, Mr President, and a discourager of ser-\nvile insurrections, I am not prepared to see the\nslaves possess that knowledge which alone is\nwanting to induce them to perpetrate acts of tar-\nbarity and retaliation, at which humanity must\nshudder.' Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

It will\nbe recollected that in his challenge to Anti-Colo-\nnizationists, Mr Orr prescribed the same terms\n(with a trifling exception) as did the Shade of\nAshmun. This circumstance induced me to think\nthat Mr Orr was the Shade of Ashraun.\nWe are likewise reminded that my attack on\nMr 0. was published in the N. Y. Sentinel, a\npaper which was not included in the conditions\nstipulated by the Shade of Ashmun.' Very well.\nI did not address the Shade of Ashmun, nor did\nI contemplate holding the controversy with him ;\non the contrary, it was expressly understood that\nthe controversy, on his part, was to be relinquish-\ned, unless he should consent to comply with my\nrequisitions. The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility! What cunning geniuses coloniza-\ntionists are !!\nThis is no time to cavil; the subject of Colo-\nnization is too weighty to be trifled with.\nDo I now challenge the Rev. Isaac Orr to\ndiscuss the merits of the American Colonization\nSociety with me upon the following terms : Mr\nOrr shall reply to the article aldressed to him\npublished in the N. Y. Sentinel of Dec. 24. The\narticles of the controversy shall be published in\nthe American Spectator, shall be alternato, and\noccupy an equal proportion of space. A copy of\nthe papers, containing said articles, to be directed\nto me in this city.\nWe shall now have an opportunity to test Mr\nOrr's courage and sincerity.'\nGARDNER JONES.\nNew-York, March 7th, 1832.\n'my",

What must be the constituents of\nsuch a representative?\nMr. Speaker, I am almost afraid to trust myseli\non this subject ; but representing a free people, i\nought to speak as I know they would speak, were\nthey personally present, and I know they would fling\ndefiance in your very teeth on this subject. To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance. I war gentlemen what they do. The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

The\nPhiladelphia could afford them no relief. Numerous\nanimals of various descriptions, wild and domestic,\nthat could climb, were to be seen in the tops of the\ntrees, and fowls innumerable. Houses in numbers\nseen floating away, and hogs and other domestic\nanimals upo: logs uttering the most dismal cries. In\nfact the passengers agree in representing the Ohio\nand its banks as one vast scene of misery and dis-\ntress, such as has never been witnessed before.\nhe Jefferson Democrat states, that the town of\nSteubenville was 8 feet under water, and that the\nhouses in Warrentown, 14 miles below, had been\nhalf carried away by the force of the current-a-\nmong them, was a warehouse, containing 300 bols.\nof flour, which lodged on Wheeling Island. Some\nhouses at Bridgeport have also been swept away,\nand that place inundated.\nens\nOn the 4th inst. a skiff containing nine passen-\ngers, was capsized in crossing the Monongahela riv-\nfive of whom were drowned, namely, Mr. Lowe,\nhis wife and only child, and Mrs. Clark and sister.\nMr. Clark and his three young children were saved.\nThey were but recently from England, and by this\naccident have been bere\u017ft of the only relatives they\nhad in this country.",

His perso\nis good, his manner free and graceful, and his\naccent peculiar, such as marks the Indian fron\nthe white man. His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion. A per-\nson standing near him caught his coat to hold\nhim, but as the order was given to fire he made a\nspring, broke loose from the hold, and was before\nthe nouth of the gun just as it went off. His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together. The\nupper part, consisting of the head, arms, and\nbreast, was thrown thirty or forty feet in the air,\nand struck the ground about thirty feet from the\nother portion.\nWorthy of notice. The fine ship Alert, be-\nlonging to Messrs. Perkins & Co. of Boston, com-\nmanded by James W. Seaver, Esq. of Kingston,\nMass. recently arrived here from Canton, has per-\nformed her voyage from Boston to Europe, from\nthence to Canton and back, in the unprecedented\ntime of nine months and twenty days, having de-\nlivered and received four full cargoes in her ab-\nsence, during which time not a drop of ardent\nspirits has been used by the officers and crew, or\nby any visitor on board, having left the country\nwithout any of any description, except a small\nquantity of eau de vie,' as a medicine, for which,\nfrom their continual good health during the voy-\nage, they found no necessity to call to their aid.\n- Journal of Commerce.\nCincinnati, Feb. 29.-Every day brings us,\nand every day shows us, further ravages of this\ngreat and sweeping calamity. A gentleman of\nunquestionable veracity informs us that in one\nhundred miles distance, above the mouth of Cum-\nberland, he counted sixty-nine houses afloat on\nthe Ohio in a single day, between sunrise and\nsunset. Lawrenceburg, only about twenty miles\nbelow us, we are informed, was so completely\ninundated, that not a family was left in the place,\nall having fled to the high ground in the neigh-\nborhood, and in that distressed situation, compel-\nled to abide the peltings of the pitiless storm,'\nand endure the severe cold which followed it.\nWe learn from good authority, that the late\nrise exceeded that of 1793 by three feet six inch-\nes, and that of 1815 by five feet ten inches. In\nour counting room 4th story Latham's buildings,\nthe water was eight feet two inches deep.\nAn enormous iron chest has been built for the\nNew-York Savings Bank, 21 feet wide and 11\nfeet high.",

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW. C. RAYMOND, { Committee.\nH. T. BARTLETT,\nR. G. LATTING, Sec. 9th Dist.\nB. K. HOWELL, ? Committee.",

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

                    "ocr_text": "LETTER FROM HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\nTo the Editors of the N. Y. Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

                    "ocr_text": "a\nLet us recall briefly to our English readers what\nthis war really is. And in the first place, let us\nlave done, once and forever, with the talk about its\nbeing a war of rival tariffs.\nProtection and Free Trade have nothing to do\nwith it. The Protective System originated with\nthe South. Every tariff has passed by Southern\nvotes. There has been no session in which the\nSouth and the (so-called) Free-Trade Democracy\nof the North could not have controlled the legisla-\ntion of Congress. More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

                    "ocr_text": "up\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE SLAVES\nEMANCIPATED BY WAR?\nThe popular instinct, which goes right to the trut\nof the matter, says, \u201c Slavery made the war; let i\ntake the consequences of war.\u201d We expect tha\nnothing more just than that could be proclaimed\nfrom Sinai itself. But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

We have endured every\nact of war as if it was a right which belonged to\nthe rebels. It may be that nothing but some serious\ndisaster to our cause will establish just distinctions,\nand force us to the exercise of belligerent rights.\nBut if we have not a right to crush this rebellion as\na crime, and to hang the ringleaders as traitors, we\nhave no right to resort to force at all. If they have\nthe right to make war upon the government, and\nare nothing but prisoners of war when taken, then\ntheir independent rights are conceded, and we have\nno right to carry on the war on our part. The\npresent treatment does nothing but strengthen und\nextend the rebellion.

Sometimes the assassin is taken.\nThen he becomes a prisoner of war, and in due\ntime is exchanged, or disemon tali the oath\nof allegiance, to go on shooting our sentimosain.\nBy the principle of war, every individual of the\nhostile people is at war, and is responsible in life\nand property. Modern Warfare has, to some ex-\ntent, ameliorated this by sparing private property,\nand the persons of those not actually combatant.\nBut this is conceded only on the ground that the\nhostile inhabitants are peaceable, and do not molest\nthe troops. If they do, they are liable to every\npenalty of war, both in person and property, and\nwar does not admit of nice discriminations.\nThe guerrilla assassination of our troops every-\nwhere in Virginia would justify, according to the\nmost humane rules of war, the severest retaliation\nupon the inhabitants and their property. But the\nmore they shoot our pickets, the more we strive to\nshow our regard for the sanctity of their persons\nand property; and the severest penalties are in-\nflicted on the soldiers of the government who have\nexercised a soldier's right to plunder armed ene-\nmies,\nThe result of this course is seen in Virginia and\neverywhere in the infected districts. Rebellion is\nthe safest business now carried on in the country.\nIts consequences are a farce - a mere joke-an\noath. What can be a richer joke to a Southern\nrebel than an oath of allegiance ? Our army holds\nno more ground than its bayonets cover. Pickets of\nthe rebels everywhere surround it with impunity,\ncutting it off from intelligence, building batteries\nunder its very guns, setting ambushes, and amusing\nthemselves by picking off our sentinels. If they\nare taken, it ends as a joke.\nOur President proclaims that rebel privateers will\nbe treated as pirates, and we growl at England be-\ncause she does not proclaim the same. But a rebel\nprivateer is taken, and her crew, instead of being\nsuspended at once to the yard-arm, are brought to\nNew York to take advantage of the law's delay,\nand the glorious right of trial by jury, with the\nchance of aid from some judicial traitor, by one of\nwhom the Administration has already been cowed.\nFrom the Atlantic to the Mississippi, supplies are\ncontinually transported from the North to the rebel\narmy, and the government resorts to no efficient\nmeasures to prevent; but, on the other hand, is\nquoted by conditional rebels as indorsing a neu-\ntrality which is protecting and supplying the rebel\narmy, and doing more to aid it and destroy the gov-\nernment, than could be done by its active hostility.\nThe war has never yet been recognized as an\nexisting fact, by our side. We have endured every\nact of war as if it was a right which belonged to\nthe rebels. It may be that nothing but some serious\ndisaster to our cause will establish just distinctions,\nand force us to the exercise of belligerent rights.\nBut if we have not a right to crush this rebellion as\na crime, and to hang the ringleaders as traitors, we\nhave no right to resort to force at all. If they have\nthe right to make war upon the government, and\nare nothing but prisoners of war when taken, then\ntheir independent rights are conceded, and we have\nno right to carry on the war on our part. The\npresent treatment does nothing but strengthen und\nextend the rebellion. Until our forces treat the\nrebellion as treason, and resort to every belligerent\nright to cripple its power and crush it into submis-\nsion by every penalty of war, we shall make no\nprogress against it.--Cincinnati Gazette.\na\nWASHINGTON, June 11th.\nThree slaves were\ntaken into one of the camps yesterday. A Mr.\nWebb, of Virginia, claimed to be their owner, and\ndemanded them. The Colonel refused, deeming\nthem contraband. They were sent over to General\nSandford's quarters, upon his order, where Webb\nagain presented himself, and General Sandford sent\nfor a wagon at his own expense, into which the three\nnegroes were placed, and sent back to Virginia, to\nthe entire satisfaction of their secession master. This\nact on General Sandford's part has given rise to\nmuch comment to-day, and he gets very little credit\nin any quarter, save among the rebel slave-owners\nover the river.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt.

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

It will\nbe recollected that in his challenge to Anti-Colo-\nnizationists, Mr Orr prescribed the same terms\n(with a trifling exception) as did the Shade of\nAshmun. This circumstance induced me to think\nthat Mr Orr was the Shade of Ashraun.\nWe are likewise reminded that my attack on\nMr 0. was published in the N. Y.

Very well.\nI did not address the Shade of Ashmun, nor did\nI contemplate holding the controversy with him ;\non the contrary, it was expressly understood that\nthe controversy, on his part, was to be relinquish-\ned, unless he should consent to comply with my\nrequisitions. The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility!

What must be the constituents of\nsuch a representative?\nMr. Speaker, I am almost afraid to trust myseli\non this subject ; but representing a free people, i\nought to speak as I know they would speak, were\nthey personally present, and I know they would fling\ndefiance in your very teeth on this subject. To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance. I war gentlemen what they do. The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

                    "ocr_text": "It was\nonce\nFrom the Daily Advocate.\nSpeech of John Ridge,\nA CHEROKEE CHIEF,\nAt a meeting in the Old South Church, March 7\nMr. RIDGE, the senior delegate from the Che\nrokee nation, rose to address the audience, and\nwas greeted with great applause. His perso\nis good, his manner free and graceful, and his\naccent peculiar, such as marks the Indian fron\nthe white man. His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

I con-\nsulted a few friends on the subject of having\na public meeting there ; none seemed willing\nto take any share in the responsibility of such\na movement; yet, none manifested any ob-\njection to my making an appointment. I finally\ndetermined to apply for the City Hall, which\nwas generously granted me by the Council\nBoard, without a dissenting voice. The meet-\ning was publicly notified to be held on the\nevening of the 10th. In the afternoon of that\nday, I was informed that public sentiment was\nvery strong against me, and I was led to ex-\npeet there might be some opposition. At the\nappointed hour, I went to the Hall, under feel-\nings of peculiar solemnity, to plead the cause\nof the oppressed before a congregation where\nslavery is a prominent feature in their civil\npolity. The evening was wet and boisterous;\nnevertheless, I had a respectable audience.\nI knew not the sentiments or feelings of a\nsingle one of them; but having come there\nnot in my own name, but in the name of suf-\nfering humanity, relying not upon myself, nor\nupon an arm of flesh, for protection, but upon\nthat Almighty arm of love and power, which\nwas so signally extended for the deliverance\nof Israel from Egyptian bondage, I was\nstrengthened to stand fearlessly as the advo-\ncate of the poor, despised descendants of\nAfrica. I have in no instance before, used\nlanguage equally severe against the oppres-\nsors, as I used on this occasion. I mention\nthis, because I think it my duty to record the\nliberality of the audience, who not only heard\nme patiently through, with the most respect-\nful attention, but gave me at the close an ex-\npression of approbation, and concurrent feel-\ning, and concluded with a contribution to our\nschool fund of $21,06.\nThe next day I called on several friends,\nand was cheered to find that there were a\nnumber in that place, prepared to co-operate\nin any measures, sanctioned by law, humanity\nand religion,' to effect the abolition of slavery.\nIn the afternoon, I returned to Philadelphia\nin the boat; on board of which was a wealthy\ncitizen of Wilmington,* who, not knowing me,\ninformed me that a person had been lecturing\nin Wilmingion on slavery, and that he had\nendeavored, but in vain, to get others to join\nhim, to go and take the lecturer out of the\nHall. When I informed him that I was the\nperson, he took a look, and seemed quite in-\ndisposed for any further conversation on the\nsubject.\nOn arriving in this city, I had the pleasure\nof taking tea, and spending the evening at the\nhouse of our friend Joseph Cassey, in company\nwith James Forten and Robert Purvis and\ntheir families, Capt. Sargent from London,\nEvan Lewis and Dr. Atlee, of this city, and\nProfessor Wright and lady, who are on their\nway to take up their residence in New-York.\nI trust the day is not far distant, when such\nsocial parties will be far more frequent than\nhas heretofore been the case.\nYet, my friends, I mourn over the hardness\nand obduracy of the human heart, which so\ngenerally in this highly favored land rejects a\nbrother who is 'guilty of a skin not colored\nlike our own.' Ah! when shall the glorious\nday dawn, in which the principles of the gos-\npel of Jesus Christ shall be submitted to, by\nthose who are called by his name? When\nthe professors of the Christian religion shall\nlearn to regard every man as a brother, and\nnot to despise him because the Supreme Ruler\nof the Universe has seen fit in his inscrutable\nwisdom, to give to one a different complexion\nfrom another? When shall this unholy pre-\njudice, which must, of necessity, forever ex-\nclude the soul which harbors it from the king-\ndom of God, be done away. Will its removal\never be accomplished by that persevering cru-\nsade against the people of color, which is now\nstriving to banish them from this good land,\nthis land of literature and of arts, this land of\nbibles and churches, to the burning shores of\nLiberia. No-persecution, though professed-\nly for their good, is not the way to exterminate\nfrom our own bosoms those fiend-like preju-\ndices. Let the nation, then, as it values its\nown prosperity, abandon the Colonization cru-\nsade, and set about improving the condition\nof the colored population of our country, and\nspending the money, which is now thrown\naway on that foolish enterprise, in educating\nthat deeply injured portion of our population.\nWe should soon find them adding strength and\nstability to our institutions, and contributing\ntheir full share to the respectability and pros-\nperity of the nation.\nAdieu,\nARNOLD BUFFUM.\nHe lived 5 miles from Wilmington, a Frenchman, [For the Liberator.]\nPROTEST AGAINST THE AMERICAN\nCOLONIZATION SOCIETY.\nMe. Editor : The Protest, signed by\nWILBERFORCE, and the other principal Abo-\nlitionists in England, has excited the wrath of\nall classes of the oppressors and their compro-\nmising friends. Nothing is more ludicrous,\nwere it not so distressing, as to witness the\nsophistry and cunning craftiness with which\nsome men attempt to destroy the influence of\ntruth, while they at the same time profess to\nlove and defend it. Of this, the New-York\nObserver, of Oct. 5, furnishes a melancholy\nspecimen. The Protest of those renowned\nphilanthropists is published with their com-\nments, the character of which is exactly simi-\nlar to the double-dealing implied in a ques-\ntion in the Observer of September 21. It is\nasked What shall a Christian do with slaves\nin his possession, in States where the laws do\nno not permit emancipation?' This inquiry\nis just as wise, as if a man were to ask-\n\"What shall a receiver of stolen goods do\nwith articles in his possession, which he can\nretain and use without discovery?'\nIt is recorded of Charles II. that at a meet-\ning of the Royal Society of London, he once\nproposed this question- Why does a fish\nweigh more out of the water than in the wa-\nter?' One adduced lis philosophical explan-\nation, and another a different hypothesis; and\nafter a variety of reasons,with which the merry\nmonarch was greatly delighted; at last, he ap-\npealed to a famous ichthyologist for his views.\n\"I deny the fact;' was the reply. Upon which\nthe king stated, that he had only proposed the\ninquiry to amuse himself at the expense of\ntheir pretended learning.\nIn proposing the above question, the editors\nof the Observer, also, must have intended to\namuse themselves at the expense of the slave-\nholders. 'I deny the fact,'\u2014that a man-steal-\ner, or a receiver and holder of kidnapped men,\nwomen and children, can prove his title to be a\nChristian at all. However, this evasion of\ntruth, and this strange solecism, is a complete\nexample of the manner in which they have\nattempted to conceal the truth, censure the\nProtesters, and gratify their man-stealing sub-\nscribers.\nThe N. Y. Observer, in its criticisms upon\nthe Protest, not only keeps clear of the main\ntopic, but also confounds so many other sub-\njects with it, that common readers in vain will\nread its notions. What connection is there\nbetween Sunday Schools and Bible Societies,\nand the enormous sin of man-stealing ? The\nwriter in the Observer so discusses the point,\nthat no person would suppose that there was\nany other inquiry connected with it, than a\nsimple question of national policy. \"They\ntithe the mint, and annise and cummin, and\nomit judgment, mercy and faith. It is unne-\ncessary to review their whole discussion,\nbut we must notice the prominent parts.\nThey say that many Christian slaveholders\nearnestly desire to emancipate their slaves.\nMark you! Christian man-stealers! What\nan imposing title! what glaring deception !\nwhat wrapping up of the most atrocious guilt!\nThe statement is not true, or those man-steal-\ners would instantly quit stealing. No man\nis obliged to be a thief; no man is forced to\nreceive and keep stolen goods; his guilt is\nvoluntary, and all his professions of willing-\nness to abandon slavery are mere hypocrisy,\nuntil he abandons his crime and does justice\nto the victims of his oppression. But it is by\nthus covering sin, that the slave-dealers are\npropitiated, and their subscriptions obtained.\nThe N. Y. Observer also declares that 'hun-\ndreds and thousands of slaves wish to be\nemancipated, and to be removed to Liberia.'\nThis is not directly false, but it indirectly con-\nveys an untruth, or rather it is a lie by defect.\nSlaves wish to be emancipated ;' that is the\nfact-yet they do not wish to be removed to\nLiberia; except as they are assured, that they\nhave no alternative, but either to be tortured\nand treated like beasts in America, or to risk\nstarvation and premature death in Liberia-\nand of the two, some prefer the latter. It is\na scandal to the press, that such gross imposi-\ntions should be disseminated throughout the\nworld by means of the N. Y. Observer.\nThe N. Y. Observer denies that 'the colony\nwas formed chiefly to indulge the prejudices\nof American slaveholders.' They may deny,\nbut the fact is true; and every man who\nknows any thing of the South, knows that it\nwas never intended as a scheme to facilitate\nthe emancipation of slaves, but to transport\nthe free people, and thereby to increase and\nprolong the fetters of man-stealing bondage.\nThe N. Y. Observer also denies that the\nColonization scheme 'exposes the colored\npeople to great practical persecution, in order\nto force them to emigrate.' A man who de-\nnies the existence of this system in its contin-\nual operation at the South, may just as truly\naffirm, that there is no difference between the\nchills of January and the heat of July. What\ninduced the rioters at New-Haven forcibly to\nobstruct a school for the instruction of colored\nyouth? What stimulated the ruffians at Can-\nterbury to commit every beastly outrage upon\nMiss Crandall? What brought together the\nNew-York mob of infidels and profligates to\nabuse the members of the New-York Anti-\nSlavery Society? Nothing else than a reso-\nlution, if possible, to demonstrate to the color-\ned people that, in this country, they shall en-\njoy neither the rights of man, the blessings of 6\na\neducation, the privileges of citizens, nor the\npeace of Christians\u2014and all this is not forcing\nthem too emigrate. They must be hewers of\nwood and drawers of water; they are denied\nall instruction, trafficked like cattle, slaves of\nthe vilest personal outrages both male and\nfemale, starved, worked, lacerated, and doom-\ned to hopeless servitude; and some few scores\nof the two millions are offered a transportation\nto Africa, where the cart-whip shall not\nscourge them, and their female companions\nand daughters shall not be violated before\ntheir eyes. Of two evils, as they cannot re-\nfuse one of them, they choose as they think\nthe least, and expatriate themselves to Libe-\nria to die in the seasoning. And yet, says\nthe N. Y. Observer, we have no evidence\nthat the colored people have as yet endured\nany such great practical persecution. There\nis an old saying, and the Observer thus proves\nits title to be inculpated in all its folly and\ncensure- None are so blind as those who\nwill not see.\nTo us, the manner of proceeding by all the\nparties who espouse the Colonization cause,\nis most painful. It shews that the moral sense\nand the conscientious perception of gospel\nequity are perfectly blunted. For a long time\npast, I have deprecated the course of the\ncontroversy upon slavery. It has been the\ncunning artifice of the Southern kidnappers,\nand their Northern doughfaced coadjutors, to\nintroduce a number of paltry topics into the\nfield of debate, by which the grand master-\npiece of iniquity has been concealed. The\nfriends of immediate emancipation thereby\nhave been drawn off from their momentous\nobject; they have been endeavoring to dry\nup the petty streams, while the overflowing\nfountain remains undrained; and they have\nbeen lopping off a few unsightly or withered\nbranches, while their crafty opponents have\nbeen nursing and strengthening and propping\nup the tree which sends forth all the compli-\ncated evil fruits of unrighteousness.\nIt is high time to retrace our steps, and\n\"begin at the beginning,\u2019and lay the axe to the\nroot of the tree. All the noise which we hear\nabout colonization is a mere deception,-'all\nthe professions of slaveholders and their north-\nern associates, of promoting the abolition of\nslavery,' are altogether delusive! They know\nit, and we know it. That the Colonization\nSociety was intended to be an obstruction to\nthe destruction of slavery,' they are convinced ;\nand we can prove that it has produced its de-\nsigned effects. That it is rooted in a cruel\nprejudice and alienation against the colored\npeople,' all persons are assure and even the\nNew-York Observer has not the effrontery to\ndeny this scandalous reproach upon freemen\nand Christians.\nHence, it follows, that we must recur to the\nfundamental principles of Christian morals.\nAll slaveholders, as they are oracularly defin-\ned by the Presbyterian confession of faith, are\nStealers of men, guilty of the highest kind of\ntheft, and sinners of the first rank. That must\nbe our text, with the Methodist commentary ;\nthey are impenitent transgressors, who never\nhad a sincere desire to flee from the wrath to\ncome. Consequently they must be instructed,\nwarned, admonished, menaced, and encourag-\ned to 'cease to do evil, and to learn to do well,\nlike all other violators of the law of God.\nThe matchless enormity of their sin, for slave-\nholding includes the simultaneous transgres-\nsion of the whole decalogue; the claims of\nGod, the authority of the gospel, the de-\nmands of reciprocal equity, and the horrors\nof divine exact retribution, must be re-\nsounded in all their distinctness and energy,\nuntil the sinners in Zion are afraid,\nand fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites!\nWe must cry aloud and spare not, lift up our\nvoices like trumpets, and show' Christian slave-\nholders! their trangressions, and their com-\npromising friends, the Observer's, the Record-\ner's, the Chronicle's, the Danforth's, the Fin-\nley's, and the Spectator's, with all the other\nworthy dough-faced tribes who are confedera-\nted with the land pirates; we must show them\ntheir sin's,' their deceitfulness, their impos-\ntures, and their danger; who, as the Prophet\nsays,-Amos vi: 1-6\u2014are at ease in Zion;\nwho put far away the evil day, and cause the\nseat of violence to come near; but they are\nnot grieved for the affliction of Joseph' Wo\nunto them that call evil good, and good evil;\nthat put darkness for light, and light for dark-\nness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for\nbitter!!-Isaiah y: 20.\nI long to see some one of our Anti-Slavery\nbrethren, who understands the subject, come\nout upon this topic in all its evangelical faith-\nfulness and power, and illustrate the questions\nconnected with slavery, not by the rules of\nworldly expediency, but by the standard of\ninfallible truth. This will have indiscribably\nmore effect than all the disputations respect-\ning trifles which are not of a feather's weight,\nin determining or hastening the death of that\nfiend-like monster, American Slavery.\nEXAMINER.\nWhere is the Incendiary Fanatic with\nhis Christian Firebrands? He might reply to\nthe call of Examiner. If he will send us his\nscorchers, we will scatter them.-Ed. Lib.\n6",

XII.\nBy the parson perplexed,\nHow shall we determine ?\nWatch and pray,' says the text,\n'Go to sleep,' says the sermon. ANON.\nMR. EDITOR,\u2014\nOn reading some time since the authorised\npublications of the Colonization Society, I was\nforcibly reminded of a remark made by Cot-\nton Mather, in that wonderful book, the Mag-\nnalia. Speaking of a certain place in New-\nEngland, he says, \u201cIt is a refuge for all sorts\nof consciences, so that if any man should lose\nhis religion, he would know where to go and\nfind it.' The same remark is in substance\njustly applicable to the African Repository,\nfor in that publication may be found all sorts\nof sentiments and opinions concerning slavery,\nin every variety of expression, and calculated\nto suit all sorts of consciences. In the lan-\nguage of the poet, he will indeed find,\n\"A wilderness of strange con\u201c son,\nTeeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,\nNectareous essences, Olympian sweets,\nEthereal journeys, transmarine exploits,\nAnd\u2019 Mr. Danforth with his hair on end,\nWith his own wonders, wondering for his bread.'\nDoes any person wish to read an exalted\ndescription of the intellect and disposition of\nthe blacks, their capacity for improvement,\ntheir docility and the native kindness of their\ntempers ? Let him peruse the pages of the\nAfrican Repository, and he will find abundant\nevidence that the capacity of the blacks for\nmoral and intellectual improvement, is not in-\nferior to that of their white brethren. This\nfact that publication admits, coupled however,\nwith this restriction, they must either be in-\nhabitants of Liberia, or engaged to go thither.\nUnlike all other objects, which lessen as they\nrecede from view, the blacks, who, while in\nthis country, are too mean and contemptible,\nto be noticed only to be despised by a certain\nclass, suddenly become marvellous proper\nmen\u2019the moment they determine to leave the\ncountry, and when fairly landed in Liberia,\nare paragons of moral and intellectual great-\nness, and attract the attention, the envy and\nthe admiration of the world.\nDoes any one wish to see the free blacks\nslandered, and vilified, and degraded below\nthe beasts that perish, by every combination\nof epithets that an unholy prejudice and malic-\nious fancy can invent? Let him read the pages\nof the African Repository and he will there\nfind it passim, ad libitum, every where, to his\nhearts content.\nDoes any one in short, wish to see how\nwidely different the ostensible designs of the\nSociety are from its real, practical and intended\neffects, where morality is determined by lati-\ntude, where the immutable laws of Jehovah's\nkingdom are superseded by the mutable doc-\ntrine of expediency, and where contradictions\nare almost as thickly sprinkled as right angles\nin a checker board, let him examine carefully\nthe official records of the Colonization Society\nwith the essays and letters of their Agents.\nLet us for instance, examine Mr. Danforth's\nletter of the 15th September last, a little far-\nther.

He had\noften, and previous to his journey, conversed on the\nall important and fast becoming popular subject of sla-\nvery, and had as often expressed his views on the sub-\nject, that though slavery was in the abstract a great\nevil, yet as it existed, the slaves could be in no better\ncondition than that of bondage. He contended that\nhe believed them perfectly happy, and was almost\nready to advance the doctrine so freely bruited, that\nblacks are but a step removed from the brute crea-\ntion. During his journey he had an opportunity of\nwitnessing a specimen of their happiness and also con-\nvincing proof that blacks were flesh and blood, and at\nleast possessed the feeling of human beings. But here\nthe narrative as near as I can recollect in the words\nof his lady, who accompanied him : We were riding\nin a carriage driven by a white man, when we were\nmet by a team on which the driver, a colored man,\nsat nodding his head, as if asleep. As we passed, our\ndriver, taking deliberate aim, eracked his whip in the\nface of the black, which was immediately followod by\na heart-rending shriek and profuse gush of blood, if\nindeed the eye did not come also. My husband, much\nenraged at this brutality, called out to driver to\nknow what he had done so for, and was met by the\nanswer of \" Shut up--we want none of your dom d\nyankee interferenee here, d-you; and if you\ndon't like it you can get out and walk.\u201d My husband\nhere attempted to get out of the coach to beat the dri-\nver as he said, but by holding him and reminding him\nwhere we were, he abandoned it, and we said no\nNot so our driver. He took particular care\neach slave we met, either man, woman or child, to\nturn out of the road sufficient to bring them within\nreach of his whip. When exerting all his strength to\nthe blow, he would join his fiendish laugh to their\nscreams, and turning, ask us how we liked that ?'\nmore.",

                    "ocr_text": "JUDGE DAGGETT'S CHARGE.\nAs a matter of record, and for the amaze\nment of posterity, we insert the following\nCharge of Judge Daggett, on the trial of Mis:\nPrudence Crandall for the awful crime of in\nstructing colored youth:\n\"This is an information filed by the Attor-\nney for the State, for the alledged violation o\na Statute law, passed by the General Assem\nbly, at their last session, relating to inhabitants\nthe preamble to the act, embracing the rea-\nsons for the law. It reads thus:\nWhereas attempts have been made to es-\ntablish literary Institutions in this State, fou\nthe instruction of colored persons belonging\nto other States and countries, which would\ntend to the great increase of the colored pop-\nulation of the State and thereby to the injury\nof the people; Therefore it is enacted that no\nperson shall set up or establish, in this State,\nany school, academy, or literary institution, for\nthe instruction or education of colored persons\nwho are not inhabitants of this State, nor in-\nstruct or teach in any school, academy, or lit-\nerary institution, or harbor or board, for the\npurpose of attending or being taught or in-\nstructed in any such school, any colored per-\nson not an inhabitant of any town in this\nState, without the consent, in writing, first\nobtained of a majority of the civil authority\nand select men of the town where such school\nis situated, on penalty,' &c.\nIt is alledged in this information, that since\nthe 22d day of August last, to wit, on the 24th\nday of September 1833, the defendant has\nwilfully and knowingly, harbored and boarded\ncolored persons not inhabitants of the State\nfor the purpose mentioned in said act, without\nhaving obtained in writing, the consent of the\ncivil authority and select men of the town of\nCanterbury, where the school has been set up.\nAs to the facts in this case, there seems to be\nbut little controversy. It has scarcely been\ndenied, that colored persons have been harbor-\ned and boarded by the defendant for the ob-\njects alledged, within the time set forth in this\ninformation. You, Gentlemen of the Jury,\nhave heard the evidence, and as it is your ex-\nclusive business to pass upon these facts, you\nwill say whether or not they are true.\nIf these facts are not proved to your satis-\nfaction, then you may dismiss the case, for in\nthat event you have no further duty to perform.\nIf, however, you find the facts true, then anoth-\ner duty equally important, devolves upon the\nJury. It is an undeniable proposition, that the\nJury are judges of both law and fact, in all\ncases of this nature. It is, however, equally\ntrue, that the Court is to state its opinion to\nthe Jury, upon all questions of law, arising in\nthe trial of a criminal cause, and to submit to\ntheir consideration, both law and fact, without\nany direction how to find their verdict.\n9. The counsel for the defendant have rested\nher defence upon a provision of the constitu-\ntion of the United States, claiming that the\nstatute law of this State, upon which this in-\nformation is founded, is inconsistent with that\nprovision, and therefore void. This is the\ngreat question involved in this\ncase,\nand it is\nabout to be submitted to your consideration.\nIt is admitted that there are no provisions\nin the constitution of this State which conflict\nwith this act. It may be remarked here that\nthe constitution of the United States is above\nall other law,---it is emphatically the supreme\nlaw of the land, and the Judges are so to de-\nclare it. From the highest court to the low-\nest, even that of a justice of the peace, all\nlaws, whether made by Congress or State\nLegislatures, are subject to examination, and\nwhen brought to the test of the constitution,\nmay be declared utterly void. But in order\nto do this, the court should first find the law\ncontrary, and plainly contrary to the constitu-\ntion. Although this may be done, and done\ntoo by the humblest court, yet it never should\nbe done but upon a full conviction that the\nlaw in question is unconstitutional.\nMany things said upon this trial, may be\nlaid out of the case. The consideration of\nSlavery, with all its evils and degrading con-\nsequences, may be dismissed, with the consid-\neration that it is a degrading evil. The bene-\nfits, blessings and advantages of instruction\nand education, may also cease to claim your | attention, except you may well consider tha\neducation is a fundamental privilege,' for thi\nis the basis of all free governments.\nHaving read this law, the question come\nto us with peculiar force, does it clearly violat\nthe Constitution of the United States ?-Th\nsection claimed to have been violated, read\nas follows, to wit: - Art. 4-Sec. 2.-The citi\nzens of each State, shall be entitled to a\nprivileges and immunities of citizens in th\nseveral States. It has been urged that thi\nsection was made to direct, exclusively, th\naction of the General Government, and there\nfore can never be applied to State laws. Thi\nis not the opinion of the court. The plain an\nobvious meaning of this provision, is, to secur\nto the citizens of all the States, the same privi\nleges as are secured to our own, by our ow\nState laws. Should a citizen of Connecticu\npurchase a farm in Massachusetts, and th\nLegislature of Massachusetts tax the owne\nof that farm, four times as much as they woul\ntax a citizen of Massachusetts, because th\none resided in Connecticut and the other i\nMassachusetts ; or should a law be passed b\neither of those States, that no citizen of the\nother, should reside or trade in that other, thi\nwould undoubtedly be an unconstitutional law\nand should be so declared.\nThe 2d section was provided as a substitut\nfor the 4th article of the Confederation. Tha\narticle has also been read, and by comparing\nthem, you can perceive the object intended by\nthe substitute.\nThe act in question, provides that colore\npersons who are not inhabitants of this State\nshall not be harbored and boarded, for the pur\nposes therein mentioned, within this State\nwithout the consent of the civil authority and\nselectmen of the town. We are then brough\nto the great question, are they citizens within\nthe provisions of this section of the Constitu\ntion? The law extends to all persons o\ncolor not inhabitants of this State, whethe\nthey live in the State of New-York, or in the\nWest Indies, or any other foreign country.\nIn deciding this question, I am very happy\nthat my opinion can be revised by the Supreme\nCourt of this State, and of the United States\nshould you return \u00e5 verdict against the de\nfendant.\nThe persons conteniplated in this act are\nnot citizens within the obvious meaning of that\nsection of the Constitution of the United\nStates, which I have just read. Let me begin\nby putting this plain question. Are slaves\ncitizens ? At the adoption of the Constitution\nof the United States, every State was a slave\nstate. Massachusetts had begun the work of\nemancipation within her own borders. And\nConnecticut, as early as 1784, had also enact-\ned laws making all those free at the age of\n25, who might be born within the state, after\nthat time. We all know that slavery is re-\ncognized in the Constitution, and it is the duty\nof this Court to take that Constitution as it is.\nfor we have sworn to support it. Although the\nterm \"slavery' cannot be found written out in\nthe Constitution, yet no one can mistake the\nobject of the 3d sec. of the 4th article :-\u201cNo\nperson held to service or labor in one state\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another-\nshall in consequence of any law or regulation\ntherein, be discharged from such service on\nlabor, but shall be delivered up on claim of\nthe party to whom such service or labor may\nbe due.\nThe 2d section of the 1st article, reads as\nfollows:- Representatives and direct taxes,\nshall be apportioned among the several states\nwhich may be included in this Union, accord-\ning to their respective numbers, which shall\nbe determined by adding to the whole number\nof free persons, including those bound to ser-\nvice for a term of years, and excluding Indians\nnot taxed, three fifths of all other persons.\"\nThe other persons' are slaves, and they be-\ncame the basis of representation, by adding\nthem to the white population in that propor-\ntion. Then slaves were not considered citi-\nzens by the framers of the Constitution.\nA citizen means a freeman. By referring\nto Dr. Webster, one of the most learned men\nof this or any other country, we have the fol-\nlowing definition of the term\u2014Citizen: 1st,\na native of a city, or an inhabitant who enjoys\nthe freedom and privileges of the city in which\nhe resides. 2, a townsman, a man of trade,\nnot a gentleman. 3. An inhabitant; a dweller\nin any city, town or country. 4. In the United\nStates, it means a person native or naturalized,\nwho has the privilege of exercising the elec-\nLive franchise, and of purchasing and holding\nreal estate.'\nAre Indians citizens? It is admitted in the\nargument that they are not, but it is said they\nDelong to distinct tribes. This cannot be\nCrue, because all Indians do not belong to a\ncribe. It may be now added, that by the de-\nclared law of New York, Indians are not citi-\nzens, and the learned Chancellor Kent says,\nthey never can be made citizens.' Indians\nvere literally natives of our soil,--they were\nporn here, and yet they are not citizens.\nThe Mohegans were once a mighty tribe,\npowerful and valiant; and who among us ever\nsaw one of them performing military duty, or\nexercising, with the white men, the privilege\nof the elective franchise, or holding an office ?\nAnd what is the reason? I answer, they are\nnot citizens, according to the acceptation of\nhe term in the United States.\nAre free blacks, citizens? It has been in-\ncniously said, that vessels may be owned\nnd navigated by free blacks, and the Ameri-\ncan flag will protect them; but you will re-\nmember that the statute which makes that\nprovision, is an act of Congress, and not the\nConstitution. Admit, if you please, that Mr.\nCuffee, a respectable merchant, has owned\nessels, and sailed them under the American\nlag, yet this does not prove him to be such a\ncitizen as the Constitution contemplates. But\nhat question stands undecided by any legal\nribunal within my knowlege. For the pur-\n=oses of this case it may not be necessary to\nEetermine that question.\nIt has been also urged, that as colored per-\nons may commit treason, they must be con-\nidered citizens. Every person born in the\nUnited States, as well as every person who\nmay reside here, owes allegiance of some sort\no the government, because the government\nffords him protection. Treason against this\nFovernment, consists in levying war against\nhe government of the United States, or aid-\nig its enemy in time of war.\n.\n6\nTreason may be committed by persons who are not entitled\nto the elective franchise. For if they reside\nunder the protection of the government, it\nwould be treason to levy war against that gov-\nernment, as much as if they were citizens.\nI think Chancellor Kent, whose authority it\ngives me pleasure to quote, determines this\nquestion by fair implication. Had this author\nconsidered free blacks citizens, he had an am-\nple opportunity to say so. But what he has\nsaid, excludes that idea.\nKent's Commentaries, vol. 2d, p. 258\u2014 In\nmost of the United States, there is a distinc-\ntion in respect to political privileges, between\nfree white persons and free colored persons\nof African blood; and in no part of the coun-\ntry, do the latter, in point of fact, participate\nequally with the whites, in the exercise of\ncivil and political rights. The African race\nare essentially a degraded caste, of inferior\nrank and condition in society. Marriages are\nforbidden between them and whites in some\nof the States, and when not absolutely con-\ntrary to law, they are revolting, and regarded\nas an offence against public decorum. By the\nrevised Statutes of Illinois, published in 1829,\nmarriages between whites and negroes, or\nmulattoes, are declared void, and the persons\nso married are liable to be whipped, fined and\nimprisoned. By an old Statute of Masssachu-\nsetts, of 1705, such marriages were declared\nvoid, and are so still. A similar statute pro-\nvision exists in Virginia and North Carolina.\nSuch connexions in France and Germany,\nconstitute the degraded state of concubinage,\nwhich is known in the civil law. But they\nare not legal marriages, because the parties\nwant that equality of state or condition, which\nis essential to the contract.'\nI go further back still. When the Consti-\ntution of the United States was adopted, every\nState (Massachusetts excepted) tolerated sla-\nvery. And in some of the States, down to a\nlate period, severe laws have been kept in\nforce regarding slaves. With respect to N.\nYork, at that time her laws and penalties\nwere severe indeed, and it was not until July\n4th, 1827, that this great state was ranked\namong the free states.\nTo my mind, it would be a perversion of\nterms, and the well known rule of construc-\ntion, to say that slaves, free blacks, or Indi-\nans, were citizens, within the meaning of that\nterm, as used in the Constitution. God for-\nbid that I should add to the degradation of\nthis race of men, but I am bound by my duty\nto say, they are not citizens.\nI have thus shown you that this law is not\ncontrary to the second section of the fourth\narticle of the Constitution of the U. States,\nfor that embraces only citizens.\nBut there is still another consideration: if\nthey were citizens. I am not sure this law\nwould then be unconstitutional. The Legis-\nlature may regulate schools. I am free to\nsay, that education is a fundamental privilege;\nbut this law does not prohibit schools. It pla-\nces them under the care of the civil authority\nand selectmen, and why is not this a very\nsuitable regulation? I am not sure but the\nLegislature might make a law like this, ex-\ntending the white inhabitants of other\nstates, who are unquestionably citizens, pla-\ncing all schools for them under suitable boards\nof examination, for the public good, and I can\nsee no objection to the board created by this\nWhat can the Legislature of this State do?\nIt can make any law, which any Legislature\ncan make, unless it shall violate the Constitu-\ntion of the United States or the Constitution of\nits own State, and in my opinion this law is\nnot inconsistent with either.\nThe Jury have nothing to do with the popu-\nlarity or unpopularity of this or any other law,\nwhich may come before them for adjudication.\nThey have nothing to do with its policy or\nimpolicy. Your only inquiry is, whether it\nis constitutional.\nI may say with truth, that there is no dispo-\nsition in the judicial tribunals of this State,\nnor among the people, to nullify the laws of\nthe State ; but if constitutional, to submit to\nthem, and carry them into full effect, as good\ncitizens. If individuals do not like the laws\nenacted by one Legislature, their remedy is\nat the ballot boxes. It often occurs, on sub-\njects of taxation, that laws are supposed by\nsome to be unjust and oppressive. Nearly\nevery session of the Assembly, attempts have\nbeen made to alter and change such laws, but\nas long as they exist, they must have effect.\nYou will now take this case into your con-\nsideration, and notwithstanding my opinion of\nthe law, you will return your verdict accord-\ning to law and evidence. I have done my\nduty, and you will do yours.'\nact.",

Yours truly,\nSAMUEL J. MAY.\nBedford, 30th Sept. 1833.\nRev. Sir.--On the late trial of Miss Cran-\ndall, it was thought expedient by her oppo-\nnents to attempt to deprive our whole free\ncolored population, of the protection of the\nConstitution of the United States, by denying\nthat they were citizens. Should a second trial be had, it is possible that the annexed\nauthorities may be of some use and I wil\ntherefore commit them to your care, as I have\nnot the honor of being acquainted with Miss\nCrandall's counsel.\nWith sincere respect for your exertions in\nthe cause of humanity and freedom, I remain\nRev. Sir Your very ob't servant,\nWILLIAM JAY.\nThe Rev. S. J. May.\nExtracts from \u201cReports of the proceedings\nand debates of the Convention of 1821 assem\nbled for the purpose of amending the Consti-\ntution of the State of New-York. By N. S\nCarter & W. L. Stone.\nOn a motion to insert the word 'white' be-\nfore the words 'male citizens' in the article o\nthe Constitution regulating the right of suf\nfrage.\nI would submit to the consideration of the\ncommittee whether the proposition is consist\nent with the constitution of the U. States\nThat instrument provides that 'Citizens o\neach State shall be entitled to all the privi\nleges and immunities of citizens in the seve\nral States. No longer ago than last Novem-\nber, the Legislature of this State almost\nunanimously resolved that \"If the provisions\ncontained in any proposed constitution of a\nnew State, deny to any cittzens of the existing\nStates, the privileges and immunities of citi-\nzens of such new State, that such proposed\nconstitution should not be accepted or con-\nfirmed, the same in the opinion of this Legis-\nlature being void by the Constitution of the\nUnited States.' Now Sir, is not the right of\nsuffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a\ncitizen of Pennsylvania who comes here and\ncomplies with your laws, merely because he\nis not six feet high or because he is of a dark\ncomplexion.'\u2014Speech of Peter A. Jay, p. 184.\nNo longer ago than last winter the Legis-\nlature of this State almost unanimously re-\nsolved that their Senators be instructed and\ntheir Representatives requested to prevent\nany State from being admitted into this Union\nwhich should have incorporated into her con-\nstitution any provision denying to the citizens\nof each State all the rights, privileges and\nimmunities of citizens of the several states.\nThese instructions and requests it is well\nknown, particularly referred to Missouri, and\nwere founded on a clause in her constitution\ninterdicting this very class of people from\ncoming to or settling in that state under any\npretext whatever.'--Speech of R. Clark,p.189.\n\u2018Suppose a negro owning a freehold, and\nentitled to a vote in Vermont, removes to this\nState, can we constitutionally exclude him\nfrom the privileges of voting? The constitu-\ntion of the United States provides that citizens\nof each State shall be entitled to all the privi-\nleges and immunities of citizens of the several\nStates.'--Speech of James Kent, (the Chancel-\nlor,) p. 190.\nThe constitution of the United States is\nbeyond the control of any act of any of the\nStates. It is a compact to which the people\nof this in common with those of other States\nare parties, and cannot recede from it, without\nthe consent of all. With this understanding,\nwhat let me ask, is the meaning of the pro-\nvision quoted by the gentleman from Albany\n(Mr. Kent.) Take the fact that a citizen of\ncolor entitled to all the privileges of a citizen,\ncomes here\u2014he purchases a freehold-can\nyou deny him the rights of an elector incident\nto his freehold? He is entitled to vote be-\ncause like any other citizen he is a frecholder,\nand every freeholder your laws entitled to\nvote. He comes here, he purchases property,\nhe pays your taxes, conforms to your laws-\nhow can you then under the article of the\nconstitution of the U. States which has been\nread exclude him? The gentleman from N.\nYork thinks that the meaning of this provision\nin the U.S. Constitution extends only to civil\nrights. Such is not the text, it is all rights.\nThis seems to me to lay an insuperable bar-\nrier in our way. As certainly as the children\nof any white men are citizens, so certainly the\nchildren of black men are citizens.-Speech of\nRufus King, p. 192.\nIt seems to me that some gentlemen en-\ntertain doubts whether any of our people of\ncolor are in a legal sense citizens; but these\ndoubts are unfounded. We are precluded\nfrom denying their citizenship by our uniform\nrecognition for more than forty years\u2014nay\nsome of them were citizens when this State\ncame into political existence-partook in our\nstruggle for freedom and independence, and\nwere incorporated into the body politic at its\ncreation. There is another and to my mind\nan insuperable objection to the exclusion of\nfree citizens of color from the right of suffrage,\narising from the provision of the Constitution\nof the U.S. that the citizens of each State\nshall be entitled to all the privileges and im-\nmunities of citizens in the several States.?-\nSpeech of Abraham Van Vechten, p. 193.\nLetter from De Witt Clinton, Governor of\nN. York to President Adams.\nALBANY, 4th Sept. 1826.\nSir, I have the honor to enclose copies of\nthe proceedings of a respectable meeting in\nWest Chester County in this State, and of an\nAffidavit of John Owen, by which it appears\nthat one Gilbert Horton a free man of color\nand a citizen of this State is unlawfully impris-\noned in the jail of the city of Washington, and\nis advertised to be sold by the Marshal of the\nDistrict of Columbia. From whatever author-\nity a law authorising such proceedings may\nhave emanated, whether from the municipality\nof Washington, the Legislature of Maryland,\nor the Congress of the United States, it is at\nleast void and unconstitutional in its applica-\ntion to a citizen, and could never have intend-\ned to extend further than to fugitive slaves.\nAs the District of Columbia is under the ex-\nclusive control of the National Govornment I\nconceive it my duty to apply to you for the\nliberation of Gilbert Horton as a freeman, and\na citizen, and feel persuaded that this request\nwill be followed by immediate relief.\nI have the honor to be &c.\nDE WITT CLINTON.\nThe President of the U.S.",

                    "ocr_text": "[From the London Patriot of July 10.]\nAMERICAN COLONIZATION\nSOCIETY\nIn our paper of this day will be found a\nreport of the Second Lecture given by Mr.\nGARRison, the agent to the New-England\nAnti-Slavery Society, and a communication,\ndesigned as a counter-statement, from Mr.\nElliott Cresson, a representative of the\nAmerican Colonization Society; a Society\nwhich stands pledged to the pursuit of one\nobject exclusively-the colonization of free\npersons of color in Africa or some other place.\nWhy should these two objects be deemed\nincompatible\u2014the abolition of slavery and the\ncolonization of Africa by free or emancipated\nblacks? We have in this country an Afri-\ncan Institution and an Anti-Slavery Society.\nThey are not deemed with us to be in opposi-\ntion to each other, but the reverse; and the\nchief promoters of the colony of Sierra Le-\none have been foremost among the advocates\nfor the total emancipation of the West India\nslave population. How comes it to pass, then,\nthat Mr. Garrison and Mr. Cresson are thus\nat open variance?\nThe plain answer to these questions is, that\nthe American Colonization Society does not\nmerely confine itself to its avowed object,\nAfrican colonization, which it would be justi-\nfied in doing, but that, unlike the originators\nand members of the African Institution in this\ncountry, it opposes the emancipation of slaves,\nexcept on the condition of their expulsion from\ntheir native land; and it founds this opposition\nupon delusive pretexts and principles of an\nunjust and anti-Christian character.\nThis is what Mr. Garrison affirms, and chal-\nlenges Mr. Cresson to disprove. The latter\ngentleman has refused to accept the chal-\nlenge, or to meet his countryman before a\nBritish audience. His only answer is, a plea\nin favor of Liberia, as adapted to civilize Afri-\nca, and to put down the slave trade. Is this\nan answer, or a mere evasion ?\nAs friends to Sierra Leone, we must be\nfriends, also, to Liberia. We applaud the en-\nterprise, whatever motives have actuated its\npromoters. We take the liveliest interest in\nAfrican colonization, and cordially wish suc-\ncess to the American Colonization Society, so\nfar as Liberia is concerned. But, excellent as\nis their avowed object, we regard the avowed\nprinciples upon which they pursue that object\nas detestable. Upon this point we should be\nglad to find ourselves in error; but we will not\nsuffer ourselves or the public to be deceived.\nThe avowed principles of the American\nColonization Society, then, as interpreted in\ntheir own documents, are- _That the free peo-\nple of color in the United States are, solely\non account of their color or race, justly and\nnecessarily deprived of citizenship and of the\nprivileges of white freemen: that, although\nborn in America of native parents, and of\nmixed breed, they are to be considered as for-\neigners, and Africa as their native country:\nthat, however intelligent, well-educated, and\nvirtuous, their expulsion from their native\ncountry is a most desirable object, because\ntheir color unjustly deprives them of their so-\ncial rights, and it is determined to persist in\nthat injustice: that no more blacks ought to\nbe made free, except on the condition of their\nexpatriation to the pestilential shores of Gin-\nea: that all attempts to raise the character of\nthe blacks at home ought to be discountenan-\nced: that slavery is a necessary evil : that the\nslave-owners have an undoubted right to hold\ntheir negroes in predial bondage: and, that\ntheir emancipation is not desirable, except in\nplaces where slave labor is unprofitable, or in\nsuch numbers as may keep down the ruinous\nincrease of the slave population, so as to les-\nsen the danger arising from it to the State.\nIn proof that these are the sentiments of the\nprincipal supporters of the American Coloni-\nzation Society, we refer to the North Amer-\nican Review, No. lxxvi., to Mr. Garrison's\npamphlet, and to an article on the Claims of\nthe Blacks in the Eclectic Review for Febru-\nary last.\nMr. Cresson is reported to have styled the\nlast of these an atrocious' article. Mild as\nis our Quaker friend, he can use strong, lan-\nguage. Let him, if he can, disprove a single statement in that article, or his anger will not\nbe construed to the advantage of his cause.\nWe are extremely reluctant to give up our\ngood opinion of Mr. Cresson's motives; but ||\nhis proceedings are fast alienating from him\nthose who have given him the most substan-\ntial proofs of being friends to Liberia, but who\nare enemies to injustice and deception.\nThe fact is, that, in those slave States of\nAmerica, where sugar cannot be cultivated,\nthe slaves have increased too fast; the supply\nis in excess; and the price of slaves has fal-\nlen so low as not to pay for breeding them for\nthe slave-market. Slavery can be profitable\nonly where labor is scarce in proportion to the\ndemand. This has ceased to be the case in\nAmerica. Free labor has driven slave labor\nout of the market in all the Middle States.\nThe slave-owners in these States absolutely\ndo not know what to do with their superfluous\nlive stock. The increase of numbers is\nthus tending to destroy slavery in America.\nHence, the anxiety to counteract that danger-\nous increase by colonization. Hence, the\nmost zealous friends of colonization in Amer-\nica are slave-owners. Hence, too, the prin-\ncipal promoters of the scheme are the great-\nest enemies to general emancipation, and the\nmost illiberal opponents of the claims of the\nblacks.\nDoes Mr. Cresson admit these facts or deny\nthem? Yes or No? If he will not meet Mr.\nGarrison, he must answer us in some shape,\nor he shall be met everywhere with this 'atro-\ncious' picture. It shall haunt him like an evil\nconscience. We are no partizans of Mr.\nGarrison's. We have never spoken to that gen-\ntleman or seen him; we know nothing of him\nbut from his publication. But from what we\nknow of facts, we say again, that Mr. Elliott\nCresson, notwithstanding the countenance he\nhas been so fortunate as to obtain in high\nquarters, will do well fairly to grapple with\nthe charges brought against the Society he\nrepresents, or take his passage for Philadelphia.\n[From the London Patriot of July 24.]\nAMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY.\nTo the Editor of the Patriot :-\nS\u0131r,--By publishing in the Patriot the fol-\nlowing letters, which have been addressed to\nme by two eminent advocates of negro eman-\ncipation, I do not doubt that you will not only\nhasten the liberation of more than two milions\nof slaves in the United States, and the down-\nfall of that brazen hand-maid of slavery, the\nAmerican Colonization Society, but also pre-\nvent many a benevolent and confiding' person\nfrom giving his money to the agent of that\nSociety. For notwithstanding he stands pub-\nlicly charged, by the leading abolitionists in\nthis country, with having misrepresented the\ncharacter and objects of the Colonization So-\nciety, and notwithstanding he has pusillan-\nimously shrunk from the offer of a public dis-\ncussion in this metropolis, to my astonishment\nI learn that Mr. Cresson, in company with an\nIrish female partisan, has either departed, or\nis about to depart, for Ireland, in order to ob-\ntain new charities for a scheme which is 'full\nof all deceivableness of unrighteousness.'\nHappily, the imposture is now generally un-\nderstood; and the speech of the eloquent\nO'Connell, at Exeter Hall, on the 13th instant,\nin opposition to the Society, will anticipate\nthe arrival of Mr. Cresson in Dublin.\nYour much obliged servant,\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.\n18, Aldermanbury, July 22, 1833.\nConway, North Wales, July 14, 1833.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014Our friend, Mr. Cropper,\nwill have informed you of the impossibility of\nmy complying with your request, of sending\nyou an explanation of the causes of my ab-\nsence from your meeting yesterday. I cer-\ntainly would not willingly have been absent;\nfor it was my desire to take every fair oppor-\ntunity of testifying my utter and increasing\ndisapprobation of the principles professed, on\nthe subject of negro slavery, by the American\nColonization Society. I can have no objec-\ntion, indeed, to the plan of colonizing in Af-\nrica, with a view to its civilization, and to the\nextension of Christianity in that deeply injur-\ned quarter of the globe. On the contrary, I\ndesire above all things to see such plans, con-\nceived in the true spirit of philanthrophy, mul-\ntiplying on that coast. But the Colonization\nSociety appears to me to adopt, as the basis\nof its schemes, not the love, but the hatred\nand contempt of the negro race, and to regard\nevery one tinged with their blood as an object,\nnot of kindness and brotherhood, but of ab-\nhorrence, and of exclusion from the common\nsympathies and affinities of our nature, and\nfrom that union and fellowship in that Saviour,\nin whom there is neither Jew nor Gentile,\nBarbarian nor Scythian, American nor Afri-\ncan, black nor white, bond nor free, but we\nare all one in Christ Jesus.\nThe unchristian prejudice of color, which\nalone has given birth to the Colonization So-\nciety, though varnished over with other more\nplausible pretences, and veiled under a pro-\nfession of a Christian regard for the temporal\ns and spiritual interests of the negro, which is\nbelied by the whole course of its reasonings,\nel and the spirit of its measures; is so detesta-\na a\nfree negro.\ncess.\nble in itself, that I think it ought not to be tol-fr\nerated, but, on the contrary, ought to be de- L\nnounced and opposed by all humane, and es-\npecially by all pious persons in this country.\nAnd it especially becomes those who have a\ntaken any active part on behalf of the negro\nrace, whether in this country or in the United a\nStates, to keep aloof from all co-operation\nwith a body whose evident purpose is adverse, t\nnot only to the liberty of the enslaved negro,\nbut to the moral and political elevation of the\nI beg to express my sense of the eminent L\nservices you have rendered to the cause of\nhumanity, by your able and persevering expo-\nsure of the evil tendency of the principles on\nwhich the Colonization Society acts, and trust\nthat\nyour\nexertions will be crowned with suc-\nI remain, my dear sir,\nYours very faithfully,\nZACHARY MACAULAY.\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, Esq.\nParadise Row, Stoke Newington,\n15th of 7th month, 1833.\nEsteemed Friend, William Lloyd Garrison-\nWhen I first heard of the formation of the\ncolony at Liberia, I rejoiced at the intelli-\ngen\u00e7e, not doubting but that it was projected\nand planned by the friends of Africa, with\nfeelings congenial with my own; that its ob-\nject was to promote the civilization of the in-\nhabitants of that vast continent, and make\nsome reparation for the enormous wrongs they\nhad for so many ages endured. This must be\nthe excuse of many in this country, and per-\nhaps in North America also, who have coun-\ntenanced or patronized the American Coloni-\nzation Society. I have repeatedly told Elliott\nCresson that, so far from being an enemy to\nthis American colony, I should be glad to see\ntwenty more of them established, that so a\nmore extended line of coast might be protect-\ned against the slave traders.at having\nheard thy exposition of the origin and main\nobject of the American Colonization Society,\nat the meeting on the 13th instant, at Exeter\nHall, and having read their own printed docu-\nments, I scarcely know how edequately to ex-\npress my surprise and indignation-surprise,\nthat my correspondents in North America\nshould not have informed me of the real prin-\nciples of the said Society; and also that Elli-\nott Cresson, knowing, as he must have known,\nthe abominable sentiments it had printed and\npublished, should have condescended to be-\ncome its agent. My indignation is roused\nwhen I find it asserted in one of their publi-\ncations, that the free people of color consti-\ntute a class, 'out of which no individual can\nbe elevated, and below which none can be\ndepressed. Again,\u2014We have endeavored,\nbut endeavored in vain, to restore them either\nto self-respect, or to the respect of others. It\nis not our fault that we have failed-it is not\ntheirs. It has resulted from a cause over\nwhich neither we nor they can ever have any\ncontrol. Here, therefore, they must be for-\never debased; more than this, they must be\nfor ever useless; more even than this, they\nmust be for ever a nuisance, from which it\nwere a blessing for society to be rid.' Again,\n\"Is it not wise, then, for the free people of co-\nlor and their friends to admit, what cannot\nreasonably be doubted, that the people of color\nmust, in this country, remain for ages, proba-\nbly for ever, a separate and inferior caste,\nweighed down by causes, powerful, universal,\ninevitable, which neither legislation nor Chris-\ntianity can remove?' If it be said that these\nare quotations from the African Repository,\nI understand that it is the ground maintained\nby the American Colonization Society. This\nbeing the case, I cannot but feel indignant\nthat the benevolence of Great Britain and Ire-\nland should have been so imposed upon, to the\namount of the subscriptions obtained under\nthe circumstances stated; and I do hope that\nan account will be called for of the sums sub-\nscribed, and of their application.\nI rejoice that you have formed an Anti-Sla-\nvery Society in New-England, and shall be\nglad to hear that it goes on with increasing\nsuccess. Can you not find some noble spirit-\ned landholders, in your parts, (who have capi-\ntal also,) to set an example of what may be\ndone for the colored free people, by placing\nthem down upon land, and showing them how\nto cultivate it on the spade or garden plan? I\nhave to request thy acceptance of two pamph-\nlets, in which these plans are detailed. The\ncapital employed in this way might be made\nto return with ample interest.\nI remain, with great regard,\nThy sincere friend.\n\"\n\u0e32\nWM\nATTEN",

Thanks for a nation judiciary, the\nsheet anchor of our liberties, 'the world's last\nhope.\n[From the Commercial Advertiser.]\nFROM OUR CORRESPONDENT\nBROOKLYN, Ct. Oct. 4. 1833.\nMiss Prudence Crandall was brought up\ntrial yesterday, before the Supreme Court,\nover which the Honorable D. Daggett, Chief\nJustice of the State, presided, for harboring\nand boarding foreign blacks, &c.\nThe defence rested entirely on the consti-\nlutionality of the law in question, and when\nthe case was committed to the jury by Judge\nDaggett, the charge presented the most able,\nlucid and conclusive constitutional opinions\never pronounced in this State.\nHe established, by unquestionable legal\ndeductions, the constitutionality of the Con-\nnecticut law, which had before been so much\nmisunderstood.\nThe jury gave a verdict, with little or no\nhesitation against the defendant.\nAll who heard, or who may hereafter have\nopportunity to read this learned exposition of\nthe right of this State to pass the law in ques-\ntion for its own protection, will be satisfied of\nits soundness.'\nWhat will European philanthropists and\nabolitionists say to this? Who can doubt that\nif Wilberforce had lived to attain as the\nNew-York Observer hints-a better under-\nstanding of the Colonization Society, and its\n'moral influnnce,' he would have retracted his\nprotest against it?-Giving due credit, and\nmaking proper alowances for individual in-\nstances of dissent, (including great numbers\nof the uninitiated,) it can no longer be conceal-\ned or denied, that the leading intelligent in-\nfluences of the Colonization Society are\nidentified with the persecution of Miss Cran-\ndall.

                    "ocr_text": "[From the Rhode Island Philanthropist.]\nSTRENGTH OF PREJUDICE.\nMr. Editor, -I am informed (and if incor-\nrectly, should rejoice to be corrected) that the\nRev. Mr. Levington a regularly ordained and\nhighly recommended Episcopal clergyman\nfrom Baltimore, possessing also an untarnish-\ned moral and religious character, was lately\nrefused an admission into the Episcopal\nchurches in this city, to preach the gospel of\nthe grace of God. And what constituted the\ninsurmountable barrier, to this holy messen-\nger of the glad tidings of salvation, from en-\ntering the sanctuary in this city, famed for its\nattachment to the principles of civil and re-\nligious liberty, you may be ready to enquire ?\nWhy, Mr. Editor, it was not because he was\na Calvinist, or an Arminian, nor for any defect\nin intellectual power, or moral worth ; but for\nthat particular kind of depravity which with\nmultitudes never find forgiveness; that sin\nagainst the light (colored gentry) of wearing\njust such a skin as God gave him!! What\nthough the man be as pure as St. Paul, com-\nmissioned by heaven and commissioned by\nthe Bishop to preach the gospel, yet as long\nas he is thus guilty of wearing that nigger\nskin which heaven in mercy bestowed upon\nhim, he shall not degrade the pulpits of our\nEpiscopal churches, in Providence. But if\nhe would only jump out of his skin, we would\nwelcome him with smiles of complacency,\nwith half his present talent and moral integ-\nrity. And does not the church pray for the\ntime to hasten on, when Ethiopia shall stretch\nforth her hand to God? But here is one of\nher sons who has done it and with beautiful\nfeet' upon the mount of salvation, publishes\npeace to a lost world. And when he has thus\ncome near, has he been welcomed by his\nbrethren in Providence, to do the work which\nGod and the church have called him to ? No!\nThe hand of his brethren has been stretched\nout against him, and for this skin depravity, he\nis turned away and denied the privilege of\nworking in his master's vineyard! And does\nGod look at the skin of his creatures in order\nto try their moral character? Mr. Editor, I\nbegin to feel that it is time to rise up, and\nspurn with holy indignation, such a prejudice\nas that which subverts the order of God, mak-\ning the skin of a man the test of moral worth.\nI would ask those who thus rejected Mr. Lev-\nington, where they get divine authority for\nsuch a proceedure? Verily this skin depravity\ntheory would build for Mr. Levington a kitchen\nin heaven, if peradventure he might be admit-\nted within the precients of that \"holy, happy\nplace and keep far from the throne of the\nLamb of God, the purchase of his blood! But\nall this conduct can be justified, Mr. Editor,\nand the questions I have here propounded,\ncan be answered. Yes, the believers and ad-\nvocates of the skin depravity theology, can\nreadily in their own estimation, silence us and\nput us to shame too. And this they effect by\nonly asking us a simple question. This ques-\ntion like the rocks of Gibralter constitutes an\ninvulnerable fortress for them, and like the\ngreat bomb mortar invented by the French, to\nreduce the city of Antwerp, it blows Aboli-\ntionists and their arguments to fritters. It\nsounds so loud that the voice of conscience in\nthose who touch it off, is stilled by it while\nthey seem to stand and clapp their hands in\nexultation to think that it hangs truth and\nrighteousness on the horn of a dilemma !!\nAnd these be it remembered are the words of\nit, . Do you believe in amalgamation?' But\nthe distant rumbling of the thunders of God's\nwrath is already heard. A cloud of fiery in-\ndignation seems fast gathering o'er this land\nand woe betides the man or men, who thus\nlong continue to trample under foot the gol-\nden law of God, \"Thou shalt love thy neigh-\nbor as thyself.' Let the men of liberty, relig-\nion, the men of God, rise up and investigate\nthis system of 'skin depravity,' and see if in\nthe light of God's truth, it constitutes an in-\nsurmountable barrier in the way of those who\nare the subjects of it (by God's appointment)\nfrom enjoying the rights of christians and men.\nDARK COLOR.",

B.\nMundrucu, formerly a major in the Brazilian\nservice, who now resides in this city, and is a\ndealer in clothing, against Captain Baker of\nthe Steam-Boat plying between New Bedford\nand Nantucket. The nature of the action,\nwas for a breach of contract, in not carrying\nthe Plaintiff, his wife and child, together with\nhis horse and Carryall, from New Bedford to\nNantucket, in November last. The facts\nwere that the plaintiff had agreed to pay the\nfull fare in the steam boat, and that after his\nbaggage was received on board, the Captain\nrefused to admit his wife into the ladies' cabin,\nthe Plaintiff being a mulatto, or person of\ncolor, and required them to go forward, which\nthe Plaintiff refused to do. Himself and his\nbaggage were then set on shore, and the\nPlaintiff was obliged to take passage in a\npacket, after some delay. The case was ar-\ngued by David L. Child and Daniel Webster,\nfor the plaintiff, and by C. P. Curtis for De-\n| fendant. The Jury were out four hours, and\nafter receiving further instructions from the\nCourt, returned a verdict for the Plaintiff of\n$125 damages. The Defendant, we under-\nstand, has appealed.\u2014Advocate.\nAnother Murder.-A Mr Clements of New-\nOrleans, was shot a fortnight since, by I. I.\nHall, also of New Orleans, under the follow-\ning circumstances :-Hall it appears has seve-\nral slaves, and one or two colored girls, per-\nhaps free, staying at the bay of St. Louis.\nOne of the latter made use of insolent language\nto Clements, for which he slapped, and perhaps\nbeat her. Hall upon hearing of this, imme-\ndiately started for the Bay, entered the room\nof Clements while he was in bed, and told\nhim that he had come to kill him!-whereupon\nhe drew from under a cloak he wore, a double\nbarrelled gun, and fired at Clements, and was\nonly prevented from firing a second time by a\nnegro man, one of his own slaves. The con-\ntents of the gun lodged in the side of his vic-\ntim, and no hopes are entertained of his re-\ncovery. Hall has been arrested and put in\nprison. STEAM-BOAT NEW-ENGLAND.\nThere were about eighty passengers on\nboard at the time of her disaster, most of whom\nwere fortunately in their berths. Those who\nwere in the gentlemen's cabin escaped unin-\njured, while those on deck, excepting only\nfour or five, were scalded or bruised. The\nladies' cabin being on deck was badly shat-\ntered, and filled instantly with steam and\nscalding water. Every birth in this cabin\nwas occupied, even the settees. Those who\nwere in the after part generally escaped, and\nothers who remained in their berths. Some\nsprang instantly from their berths into the\nscalding water, which for a time was ancle\ndeep on the cabin floor. The explosion was\nsucceeded by the screeches and groans of the\nwounded\u2014the cries of mothers for their chil-\ndren, of wives for their husbands, and broth-\ners and sisters for one another, and for their\nfriends\u2014the bustle and confusion of getting\ndown the boats, to save those who were in\nthe water the whole constituting a scene\nwhich utterly beggars description.\nThe immediate cause of the accident must\nfor a time remain a matter of speculation and\nsurmise. The Engineer was at his post in the\nengine room, and escaped uninjured. He de-\nclares positively that there was not more than\neight inches of steam at the time. The as-\nsistant Engineer says that the guage\nup to the deck. The pilot says, that when the\nboat came to the Saybrook landing, she lay at\nanchor about 20 minutes, during which time\nno steam was blown off, that he felt alarmed\nand went down, and found there was quite\ntoo much steam on,' that once afterwards he\nwent down and found matters nearly in the\nsame condition. The place where the boat\nwas anchored is about six miles below the\nscene of the disaster, and the time that elaps-\ned from her getting under way to her stopping\nat Essex, must have been, at least, half an\nho\u1eb7r. No steam was blown off when she stop-\nped at Essex.\u2014Hartford Review.\nrod was\nWe learn by the papers that Miss Crandall\nhas been convicted before the superior court,\nchief justice Daggett presiding. The judge\nmade an elaborate argument in favor of the\nconstitutionality of the law, by which Connec-\nticut has prohibited the citizens of other states\nfrom resorting to her villages for education.\nWe envy not the feelings with which judge\nDaggett, himself a professing Christian, would\npass sentence of imprisonment upon a Chris-\ntian sister, for the crime of teaching Christians\nthe knowledge that is requisite to qualify them\nfor doing good. Such a man as Jay would\ndoubtless have renounced office for ever, be-\nfore he would have subjected himself to the\nnecessity of executing such a law.-New-York\nEvangelist.\nVarieties of the human species.-The Afri-\ncan blacks are well known to be different from\nthe Europeans, and not more so in the color\nof their skin, than the form of their lips and\nnoses, the hair of their heads, and the shape\nof their legs apland produces no men taller\nthan three cubits; their eyes, ears, and noses,\nare different from those of all other people\nwho surround them. The people of Caffraria\nare of an olive color; the people of Sophila,\nMountbaza, and Melinda, are black, but of a\ndifferent species from those of Niagritia. The\nTartars and native Americans, and the inhab-\nitants of Kamtschatka, have thin beards. Du\nHalde says, the very make of the Chinese\nmouth is different from that of the Europeans;\ntheir teeth are placed in a different manner\nfrom ours, as the under row stands out.\nSLAVERY.-A public Meeting has been held\nin New-York last week, at which upwards of\nthree thousand dollars were subscribed for\nthe purpose of colonizing free blacks in Libe-\nria, or, as the Colonizationists sometimes ex-\npress it, for the purpose of evangelizing Afri-\nca.' We look upon this as so much money\npaid for the perpetuation of slavery in the\nUnited States.

Whatever lessons either of\nthese, or their productiveness when employed\nupon each other, lessens the wealth of the\ncountry. Capital may be employed in two\nways; either to produce new capital, or mere-\nly to afford gratification, and in the production\nof that gratification be consumed, without re-\nplacing its value. The first may be called\ncapital, and the last expenditure. These will\nof course bear inverse proportions to each\nother. If the first be large, the last must be\nsmall, and vice versa. Without any change\nof the amount of wealth, capital will be in-\ncreased by the lessening of expenditure, and\nlessened by the increase of expenditure. Al-\nthough the manner of dividing makes no dif-\nference with the present amount of national\nwealth, it makes a great difference with the\nfuture amount; as it alters materially the\nsources of producing it, the means of an equal,\nor increased reproduction.\nFor instance, a man fond of noise and ex-\ncited agreeably by the hearing of it, pays a\ndollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it.\nHe occasions an entire loss of that amount of\nproperty. Although the powder maker and\nthe merchant, may both have received their\npay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it\nhas been a total loss; and if the sale of it was\nno more profitable than would have been the\nsale of some useful article, it has been an en-\ntire loss to the community. And if by the\nexplosion the man is burnt, partially loses his\nreason, is taken off for a time from business,\nand confined by sickness to his bed, must have\nnurses, physicians, &c. the loss is still increas-\ned. And if he never recovers fully his health,\nor reason, suffers in his social affections and\nmoral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the\neducation of his children, and they are more\nexposed to temptation and ruin, and he is nev-\ner again as able or willing to be habitually\nemployed in productive labor, the nation loses\nequal to the amount of all these put together.\nAnd if his example leads other men to spend,\nand to suffer in the same way, the loss is still\nfurther increased; and so on, through all its\neffects.\nAnd even though the powder maker and\nthe merchant have made enormous profit, this\ndoes not prevent the loss to the community;\nany more than the enormous profit of lottery\ngamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin,\nprevents loss to the community. Nor does it\nmeet the case, to say that the property only\nchanges hands. This is not true.\nThe man\nwho sold the powder made a profit of only a\npart even of the money which the other man\npaid for it; while he lost not only the whole,\nbut vastly more. The whole of the original\ncost was only a small part of the loss to the\nbuyer, and to the nation. The merchant gain-\ned nothing of the time, and other numerous\nexpences, which the buyer lost; nor does he in any way remunerate the community for\nthat loss.\nSuppose that man, instead of buying the\npowder, had bought a pair of shoes; and that\nthe tanner and the shoemaker had gained in\nthis case, what the powder-maker and the\nmerchant had gained in the other; and that\nby the use of the shoes, though they were\nfinally worn out, the man gained twice as much\nas he gave for them; without any loss of health,\nor reason, social affection, or moral susceptibil-\nity; and without any of the consequent evils.\nWho cannot see that it would have increased\nhis wealth, and that of the nation, without in-\njury to any, and have promoted the benefit of\nall.\nThis illustrates the principle with regard to\nardent spirit.\nA man buys a quantity of it,\nand drinks it; when he would be, as is the\ncase with every man, in all respects better\nwithout it. It is to him an entire loss. The\nmerchant may have made a profit of one quar-.\nter of the cost, but the buyer loses the whole\nand he loses the time employed in obtaining\nand drinking it. He loses also, and the com-\nmunity loses, equal to all its deteriorating ef-\nfects upon his body and mind, his children,\nand all who come under his influence. His\nland becomes less productive. The capital of\ncourse produced by his land and labor is die\nminished; and thus the means are diminished\nof future reproduction. And by the increase\nof expenditure in proportion to the capital, it\nis still farther diminished, till to meet the\nincreasingly disproportionate expences, the\nwhole is often taken, and the means of future\nreproduction are entirely exhausted.

Oth-\ners, however, have been undeceived. And we\nmay conceive what was their surprise, and\nwhat their indignation, on learning from the\nbest authority,-namely, the official documents\nof the Colonization Society itself, that they\nhad been duped by its plausible and sinooth-\nspoken representative; that, in fact, so far\nfrom the object and tendency of the Society\nbeing to exterminate slavery, it is framed upon\nprinciples, the inevitable operation of which\nis to prolong slavery to the longest period ?\nAmong those benevolent persons who were\nthus imposed upon, and who have thus discor-\nered the imposture, is Mr. William Allen.\nThey who know this gentleman are well aware\nthat he is not apt to express himself in warm\nand strong language; and yet, so clear and\ndecided are his convictions of the iniquity of\nthe system pursued by the Society on behalf\nof which Mr. Eliiott Cresson has been a-beg-\nging through these kingdoms, that, in a letter\nto Mr. GARRISON, the gentleman who has\ncome over to make us understand the real ob-\nject of Mr. Cresson's labors, he thus expresses\nhimself:\n'I scarcely know how adequately to express\nmy surprise and indignation-surprise, that my\ncorrespondents in North America should not\nhave informed me of the real principles of the\nsaid Society; and also that Elliott Cresson,\nknowing, as he must have known, the abomi-\nnable sentiments it had printed and published,\nshould have condescended to become its agent.\nI cannot but feel indignant that the benevo-\nlence of Great Britain and Ireland should have\nbeen so imposed upon, to the amount of the\nsubscriptions obtained under the circumstan-\nces stated; and I do hope that an account will\nbe called for of the sums subscribed, and of\ntheir application.'\nOur readers are aware that Mr. Cresson has\nrefused Mr. Garrison's challenge to a public\ndiscussion of the merits of the Colonization\nSociety. He may have done this for two rea-\nsons: either because he thought himself une-\nqual to such a forinidable opponent, or because\nhe was inwardly conscious of the indefensible-\nness of the Society which he represents. But\nto the very reasonable demand of Mr. Allen,\nthat he should publicly state the amount of the\nsums he has obtained and how they have been\napplied, Mr. Cresson can have no well-founded\nobjection. If he refuse to comply, the infer-\nence will not be favorable to him.",

                    "ocr_text": "[From the (N. York) Emancipator.]\nTHE PROTEST.\nJust as we expected\u2014the colonization pa-\npers are much excited by the protest from the\ndistinguished philanthropist which we publish-\ned last week. That document will work won-\nders. The last New-York Observer, which\npaper probably speaks the colonization senti-\nments of a great portion of the religious world,\nhas devoted nearly two columns to the subject\nof the protest, and labors hard to prevent the\nmask from falling from the Janus face of the\nColonization Society. But it is too late. The\nObserver attempts to answer the several speci-\nfications of the protest, and says, as an intro-\nductory remark:\n'If our English friends would form a sound\nopinion on the merits of the colonization plan,\nthey must understand the circumstances of the\ncountry; and especially the relations of differ-\nent classes of our population to the subject of\nslavery\nThe editors of the Observer must know, we\nshould suppose, that our English friends' who\nsigned the protest against the American Col-\nonization Society, 'understand what slavery\nin the United States is, quite as well as them-\nselves. It is a system so glaring as to be seen\nand read by all men who have eyes like the\ndeparted Wilberforce--not confined in their\nvision to one country or clime. It will be re-\nmembered, too, that when Mr. Gurley tortured\nthe language of Mr. Clarkson into an enco- mium of the colonization project, the correcto\nness of his understanding of this country'\nwas not doubted at all! Soon he will be found,\nwe are assured, side by side with CHARLES\nSTUART, and other philanthropists, in condem-\nnation of the colonization cbimera: what will\nthe editors say then?\n*\nIt is evident that the name of WILBER-\nFORCE, in connection with a protest against\nthe Colonization Society, has stricken confu-\nsion to the hearts of many colonizationists.\nSainted spirit! thou hast indeed put the cap-\nstone of glory on the monument of thy devot-\ned life. Never may it be forgotten. Wilber-\nforce the best of christians-the noblest of\nphilanthropists-ere he left the scene of his\ntoils for that of his rewards, repudiated the\nwicked project of banishing one-sixth part of\nour population to a heathen shore !\nThe attempt to nullify the protest of Wil-\nberforce comes at too late a day; for the en-\ncomiums passed on his venerated name' by\nthe colonization editors, are hardly dry from\ntheir pens! His name is signed-his seal is\nset-and there they will both stand, while his\ndeathless fame endures, as living testimonies\nagainst the delusive project of African colo-\nnization! Glory to God in the highest that it\nshall be so!\nWe have not space in our columns to fol-\nlow the editors of the Observer through all\ntheir answers to the remaining specification of\nour friends in England.' We have not the\nleast fear, however, of the strictures of the\nObserver. The insinuations that the mind of\nWilberforce was not properly imbued with\nevarfgelical faith,' is as ungererous and unjust\nas it is inconsistent with what the editors had\nsaid in their paper, but a week or two before,\nrespecting the distinguished philanthropist.\nThey will doubtless blush to think of it, ere\nthey die.\n\"If this cruel prejudice does exist among the\nwhites, it forms a powerful reason why they\nwho lament its existence should form a colony\nlike Liberia, 'to serve as an asylum for the poor\nvictims who are suffering under it.'\nThat is to say--we will admit this cruel\nprejudice' cannot be overcome-no-not even\nthrough the influence of the gospel of Jesus\nChrist itself\u2014by gratifying it! Will such a\ncourse at all weaken \u201cthis cruel prejudice'?\nWill it not immensely strengthen and increase\nit? Suppose we could accomplish our object\n--if there were half money enough in the na-\ntion to do it and could hold our colored broth-\ner, who has committed no crime whatever\nagainst us, at arm's length across the waters\nof the Atlantic-would this lessen our preju-\ndice any ? No-the very fact that we had\npower enough to gratify it, would augment it\na thousand fold!\n1",

He had been repeatedly admonish-\ned to keep away, but to little purpose, as his fate\nhas exhibited. When preparations were made\nfor firing the evening salute, he stationed himself\nnear the muzzle of the gun, boasting that he could\npass it, between the flash and explosion. A per-\nson standing near him caught his coat to hold\nhim, but as the order was given to fire he made a\nspring, broke loose from the hold, and was before\nthe nouth of the gun just as it went off. His\nbody was literally cut in two-the legs and about\nsix inches of the chest remaining together. The\nupper part, consisting of the head, arms, and\nbreast, was thrown thirty or forty feet in the air,\nand struck the ground about thirty feet from the\nother portion.\nWorthy of notice. The fine ship Alert, be-\nlonging to Messrs. Perkins & Co. of Boston, com-\nmanded by James W. Seaver, Esq. of Kingston,\nMass. recently arrived here from Canton, has per-\nformed her voyage from Boston to Europe, from\nthence to Canton and back, in the unprecedented\ntime of nine months and twenty days, having de-\nlivered and received four full cargoes in her ab-\nsence, during which time not a drop of ardent\nspirits has been used by the officers and crew, or\nby any visitor on board, having left the country\nwithout any of any description, except a small\nquantity of eau de vie,' as a medicine, for which,\nfrom their continual good health during the voy-\nage, they found no necessity to call to their aid.\n- Journal of Commerce.\nCincinnati, Feb. 29.-Every day brings us,\nand every day shows us, further ravages of this\ngreat and sweeping calamity. A gentleman of\nunquestionable veracity informs us that in one\nhundred miles distance, above the mouth of Cum-\nberland, he counted sixty-nine houses afloat on\nthe Ohio in a single day, between sunrise and\nsunset. Lawrenceburg, only about twenty miles\nbelow us, we are informed, was so completely\ninundated, that not a family was left in the place,\nall having fled to the high ground in the neigh-\nborhood, and in that distressed situation, compel-\nled to abide the peltings of the pitiless storm,'\nand endure the severe cold which followed it.\nWe learn from good authority, that the late\nrise exceeded that of 1793 by three feet six inch-\nes, and that of 1815 by five feet ten inches.

APPEAL.\nus.\nHow large an amount of pious cant, shameless ef-\nfrontery, and unscrupulous mendacity can be compress-\ned in a brief appeal, may be ascertained by reading\nthe following Circular from New Orleans:-\nRooms Young Men's Christian Association,\nNEW ORLEANS, May 22, 1861.\nTo the Young Men's Christian Association of North America :\nDEAR BROTHERS,In these times of hostile ex-\ncitement, we feel constrained by a sense of duty as\nChristians, to address you in the spirit of Him who\nsaid, \"Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall\nbe called the children of God.\u201d We do not wish to\ninquire into the causes which have produced the pres-\nent lamentable state of public affairs. We are will-\nng to concede to you the same sincerity which ac-\ntuates us. We wish to appeal to those principles\nand sentiments in your bosoms, upon which the re-\nligion of our Divine Savior is based, and to enlist\nyour active, earnest exertions in the cause of peace.\nWe wish you to feel with us, that there is a terrible\nresponsibility now resting upon us all as Christians,\nin this trying time of our country--that we who pro-\nfess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace, of\nHim who has said, \u201c All they that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword,\u201d as members of the\nYoung Men's Christian Associations of North Ameri-\nca, must have a fearful account to render, if we do\nnot zealously practise and enforce the principles we\nprofess.\nA war of brother against brother, of father against\nson, of father-in-law against son-in-law, is now upon\nWhoever or whatever may have caused it, we\nbelieve it to be an unnatural and unrighteous war,\nand that it is the solemn, imperious duty of every\ntrue Christian in the land to throw all the weight of\nhis influence in favor of peace. We in the South\nare gatisfied in our judgments, AND IN OUR HEARTS,\ntho the political severance of the Southern from the\nNorthern States is permanent, and SHOULD BE SAT-\nISFACTORY. We believe that reason, history and\nknowledge of human nature will suggest the folly\nand futility of a war to re-establish a political union\nbetween the severed sections. And we call upon\nyou as Christian brothers to raise your voices, in\nyour own section, for the establishment of\npeace\nand\nof Christian fellowship with us of the South. We\nimplore you to believe that we are men and Chris-\ntians, and that while we are firm and conscientious\niu our position, we sincerely desire peace and the\nrestoration of friendly relations. We believe if our\nChristian Brothers of the North will firmly, and in\nthe strength of God say, \u201cThere should be peace\nbetween the two confederacies,\u201d and will unite with\nus in prayers and efforts for that purpose, that much\ngood will be done, and that God in his faithfulness\nand love will incline the hearts of men to peace.\nHas it not occurred to you, brethren, that the hand\nof God MAY BE in this political division, that both\ngovernments may more effectually work out His de-\nsigns in the regeneration of the world? While such\na possibility may exist, let His people be careful not\nto war against His will. It is not pretended that\nthe war is to maintain religious freedom or extend\nthe kingdom of Christ. Then, God's people should\nbeware how they wage or encourage it. In the\nname of Christ and his divine teachings, we protest\nagainst the war which the Government at Washing-\nton is waging against the territory and people of the\nSouthern States; and, we call upon all the Young\nMen's Christian Associations, in the North, to unite\nwith us in this solemn protest.\nFraternally,\nR.\nW. C. RAYMOND, { Committee.\nH. T. BARTLETT,\nR. G. LATTING, Sec. 9th Dist.\nB. K. HOWELL, ? Committee.",

Millard Fillmore, and bearing the postmark of\nsome office in South Carolina. We bespeak a care-\nful reading :\n\u201cREAD, PONDER AND DIGEST.\n\" It is thought, by many at the North, that we at\nthe South are standing over a magazine of stupen-\ndous magnitude, that only wants the application of\na match to spread ruin, disaster and death, through-\nout the whole length and breadth of the Confeder-\nacy. Northern papers of wide spread popularity,\nthat may be supposed to reflect public sentiment, to\nsome extent at least, are suggesting, in unmistakable\nterms, the propriety of applying the match. Men\nof the North, beware! You who would spare the\nshedding of oceans of blood, stay your ruthless hands,\nhold in check your envenomed tongues, restrain your\nsatanic press. For, whenever the attempt is made\nto carry out that fiendish suggestion-a suggestion\nworthy the lowest, the meanest, the most sneaking,\nand at the same time blood-thirsty demon, that ever\nbuffeted the billows of hell\u2014in the manner indica-\nted, the combustible materials of which that maga-\nzine is composed will be so saturated with blood that\nall the fires of hell itself could not ignite them. In\nother words, whenever the slaves in the Border\nSlave States are incited to escape from their owners\nby hundreds and thousands, for the purpose of hav-\ning. Sharpe's rifles and Colt's revolvers placed in\ntheir hands, and marched back to butcher white\nmen, women and children; whenever the slaves in\nthe Gulf States are incited to servile insurrections,\nand the prospect bids fair for their being converted\ninto demons incarnate, then the slave owners in the\nSouth will be found ready to sacrifice every slave\nfrom whom danger may be apprehended, even\nthough it involve the destruction, by a concerted\nand simultaneous movement, of every male slave\nover the age of fifteen years, or even younger than\nthat, if the necessities of the case may seem to re-\nquire it; and willing hands will be found ready to\nexecute the bloody deed. Before Southern men\nwill suffer themselves, their wives and little ones\nto be butchered, and their daughters worse than\nbutchered, by fiends in human form, before they will\nsuffer to any considerable extent the horrors of ser-\nvile insurrections, the Gulf streams will be crimson\nwith the gore and every Southern river choked with\nfestering, carcasses of slaves. Men of the North,\nyou hold in your hands the lives of half a million\nof slaves; for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if\nthis war continues, and they, through your instru-\nmentality, become dangerous and unmanageable, the\nlast one of them will perish. Attempt, if your dare,\nto convert a portion of our population into vipers,\nand before they get ready to strike their envenomed\nfangs into our vitals, their heads shall be crushed be-\nneath our heels. Never will they be permitted to\nbecome instruments in your hands for our attempted\nsubjugation.\"\na\na men!\nZEL",

                    "ocr_text": "LETTER FROM HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\nTo the Editors of the N. Y. Independent :\nIn our letter last week, we took up the cause of\nEngland, so far as her Christian good name was im-\nplicated, in the report of her sympathy with a South-\nern slaveholding coup d'etat. We pleaded ignor-\nance for her-ignorance fostered by the long inac-\ntion and apparent imbecility of the free North.\nThere is great cause to stretch both this plea and\nour patience when steamer after steamer brings in\nthe news of one after another who have wheeled\ninto the train of secession, or stand in sn attitude of\nsuspicion and rebuke toward the North. The Lon-\ndon Anti-Slavery Reporter out with an article, show-\ning small sympathy with the North: Lord Shaftes-\nbury allowing his sympathies for the South to be\nawakened by her evident proclivities for monarchical\ninstitutions: Exeter Hall silent, or gone by the\nboard, when they think they see the United Repub-\nlic dismembered, and a slaveholding empire rising\non its ruins !\nWell, as for us, we do not need sympathy, and can\nvery well afford to dispense with it; and the univer-\nsal annoyance and soreness with which these demon-\nstrations have been received are evidence, not of\nour sense of the need of England, but of the disap-\npointment of that growing esteem and friendship\nwhich years of kindly intercourse have established.\nNations, as such, are unsentimental affairs, and ex-\nhibit the hard, unadorned, horny selfishness of hu-\nman nature in all their official acts. But the people\nof a nation have a thousand unofficial channels of\nshowing sympathies which outflow the cold hesitan-\ncies of national organization. Thus the Government\nwas cool toward Kossuth, but the people were warm ;\nthe Government was cool toward Italy, but the peo-\nple were warm,--and when a people are warm, they\nalways find means of showing it.\nThe fact is, all the Christians of foreign nations\nwho have stood aghast at the complicity of Northern\nChristians with slavery, fall into exactly the same\nnet the first time they come into exactly the same\nposition\u2014that is to say, when any of their own pur-\nsuits or interests would be injured by opposition to\nslavery. The French Protestants were ready, with\nnational vivacity, to tear their hair over the disgrace\nto a mutual Protestantism, occasioned by the silence\nof American religious bodies on the subject of slave-\nry, and rested not till they had sent over a remon-\nstrance, signed by all the Protestant pastors in\nFrance and Switzerland, to the pastors in America.\nOar pastors were conjured, with right martial\nFrench energy, to awake, and not to give place to\nsuch a sin and shame-no, not for an hour !\u2014to cry\naloud and spare not-to show to the house of Judah\ntheir sin, and so on.\nAt the heels of this trumpet came Dr. Monod to\nAmerica, to solicit material aid for these very church-\nes; and Dr. Monod immediately made the discovery\nthat the policy of the Tract Society, in keeping si-\nlence on slavery, was eminently wise and Christian.\nEngland has poured in remonstrance after remon-\nstrance upon America in every way, shape, and form\n-always well-meaning, often wanting in tact of ex-\npression, but showing, as we Americans well be-\nlieved, the stout heart of oak of old Clarkson and\nWilberforce--and so, though it galled us, we said,\n66 Faithful are the wounds of a friend.\"\nBut now the cotton crop is touched, and what are\nExeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Reporter about\nto do? What are they doing? We have heard re-\nports-we hear every steamer-and as yet have\nheard no cheers along the lines for the free men of\nthe North-and low mutterings and half-suppressed\nsympathies with the men who have driven down\ntheir flag-staff through the heart of the slave. THE\nPLATFORM THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY STAND\nON IS THE NECK OF THE NEGRO\u2014and seeing them\nstanding there, England begins, earliest of nations,\nto raise the question of acknowledgment, and Exe-\nter Hall looks on without a cheer for the free States !\nWe mean to verify our words when we say that\nthe flag-staff of the Southern Confederacy IS PLANT-\nED THROUGH THE HEART OF THE SLAVE. They\nhave published their status to the world in language\nthe most salient and unmistakable.\nLet us quote the language of Vice President\nStephens in February, 1861, in a labored attempt to\nshow to mankind the character and motives of the\nSeceding Confederacy :-\n\u201cThough last, not least, the new Constitution has\nput at rest for ever all the agitating questions relating\nto our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists\namong us, the proper status of the negro in our form\nof civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late\nrupture, and of the present revolution. Jefferson, in his\nforecast, had anticipated this as the rock upon which\nthe old Union would split. He was right. What was\nconjecture with him is now a realized fact. But,\nwhether he fully comprehended the great truth upon\nwhich that rock stood, and stands, may be doubted.\nThe prevailing ideas entertained by him, and most of\nthe leading statesmen at the time of the formation of\nthe old Constitution, were that the enslavement of the\nAfrican race was in violation of the laws of nature;\nthat it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and\npolitically. It was an evil they knew not well how to\ndeal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that\nday was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Provi-\ndence, the institution would be evanescent, and pass\naway. **** Those ideas, however, were fundamental-\nly wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality\nof races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation,\nand the idea of a government built upon it, when the storm\ncame, and wind blew, it fell.\n\u201cOur new Government is founded upon exactly the\nopposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone\nrests, on the general truth that the negro is not equal to the\nwhite man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior\nrace, is his natural and normal condition. This our new\nGovernment is the first in the history of the world, based\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\na\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n\u201cThe negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is\nfitted for the condition which he occupies in our sys-\ntem. The architect, in the construction of a building,\nlays the foundation with the proper material\u2014the\ngranite-then comes the brick or the marble. The\nsubstratum of our society is made of the material by\nnature best fitted for it, and by experience we know it\nis best, not only for the superior but the inferior race,\nthat it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with\nthe Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wis-\ndom of his ordinances, or to question them. * * * *\n\u201cThe great objects of humanity are best attained\nwhen conformed to his laws and decrees in the forma-\ntion of governments, as well as in all things else. Our\nConfederacy is founded on principles in strict conform-\nity with these laws. This STONE, WHICH WAS RE-\nJECTED BY THE BUILDERS, IS BECOME THE CHIEF\nSTONE OF THE CORNER OF OUR NEW EDIFICE.\u201d\nThis language is plain enough. He who runs may\nread.\nHere, then, is their new Jerusalem, with its negro\ngranite foundation; and the right to hold slaves, that\nstone rejected of the North, is the chief corner-stone.\n\" It has been apprehended by some,\u201d continues\nMr. Stephens,\" that we shall have arrayed against THE BON\nSLAVES\nHORSES,\nMOTHER\nCAITLE\nIN LOTS YO\nSUIT\nBURCHASTI\nSATU\n39 g OL 3KO 12\nTIARTNELL\nLOVE THY\nLIE\nSHAL\nHOV",

It has spurred up\nour flagging zeal, and backed up our fainting energy,\nmany a time, with the consciousness that all Anglo-\nSaxondom, with its great lion heart, was pressing on\nbehind us, and cheering the fray. And now that\nthe great battle is set, and the trumpet blowing, and\nwe are sending our very heart's blood out of our\nhomes and from our hearths to do battle against this\nslaveholding Babylon, where are the voices of our\nformer friends in England ? We will not say where\n-we only ask.\n. Are we to think that if this Slaveholding Confed-\neracy could put us down, and bury us and the prin-\nciples of human equality deep in a thousand graves,\nthat England would meet them in a love-feast above\nour heads, and Pilate and Herod be made friends\nover a crucified humanity ?\nIn all this contest relating to American slavery,\nhitherto it has been the part of English Christians\nto talk, and of American Christians to make sacri-\nfices. Now the time has come which brings the\nquestion of sacrifice right through the British camp.\nHow do they meet it ?\nOur merchants are losing their millions in this\nwar-but steadily saying, \u201cGo on, go on-we will\nspend our last cent;\u201d and those who are losing most\nby the war are most forward to promote it. O Eng-\nland ! England! What! could ye not watch with\nus one hour ?\nBut be it so: though all the world deny us-\nthough we stand alone, yet in God's strength we of\nthe free States of the North will fight this battle\nthrough to the end. While there is a brick in our\nchimneys, a tile on our roofs, a drop of blood in our\nhearts, every man, woman, and child of us are of\none mind to give it all to this cause--for it is the\ncause of God and liberty\u2014the cause of human rights\nand human equality; and if any have no sympathy\nwith it, so much the worse for them.\nIt is our firm belief that the prayers of many gen-\nerations are hastening to a fulfillment, and that, with\nor without the help and sympathy of foreign nations,\nthe year of Christ's redeemed has come, and that\nthis war will emancipate the slave.\nIf English Christians would follow the triumphal\nprocession when the bridegroom comes, let them trim\ntheir lamps, and put oil in them now.\na",

BRACE.\na\nI have been a careful reader of the English\nweekly press since the war with the Slaveholding\nConfederacy began. It represents the more ma-\ntured and thoughtful conclusions of the British edu-\ncated classes. With the single exception of the\nSpectator, I have scarcely found one journal that\nseemed to have an intelligent appreciation of our\ncontest. One favorite view of the question is that\nthis is a struggle between opposite parties in politi-\ncal economy; that the South represents the agri-\ncultural and free-trade interest, and the North the\nmanufacturing and protective; that the former has\nbeen robbed of its legitimate profits for a number of\nyears by the duties put by the General Govern-\nment on imports consumed by it, and now unable to\nbear this oppression longer, it rises to demand Free\nTrade and an independent Government.\nFrom Englishmen personally, it is one of the\nmost common things to hear the words, \u201c We were\nwith you\ntill you passed the Morrill Tariff.\u201d\nAnother ground of objection to our Northern\nposition is, that we are making a terrible war merely\nfor territory--for aggrandizement-to keep under\nour rule certain legal provinces and populations, who\ndo not desire to be governed by us; and further,\nthat these provinces are disgraced and weakened by\na system which has always been the clog on the\nUnion, and which we ought to be only too glad to be\nrid of. The English writers urge that this is not a\nwar against slavery, otherwise they should be in its\nfavor; but simply a war for our flag and for a vague\nidea of Nationality and Government, as to which\nthey care nothing. Private letters from diplomatic\nsources assert that if this were an anti-slavery war,\nEngland and all Europe would be enthusiastic in\nbehalf of it. The English press repeats, too, the\nSouthern phrases, that in our theory \"all govern-\nment must depend on the consent of the governed,\u201d\nand that accordingly we can do nothing but accept\nthe logical conclusion from our own premises, and\npermit the Southern Independence ;-all this urged\nwith an evident chuckle, as if they were glad to see\nDemocracy thus taken on the hip!\nDe Tocqueville somewhere remarks that he has\noften wondered what faculty it is in the human mind\nwhich always leads the English to believe any posi-\ntion their interest forces them to take as profoundly\nand morally right. At the present moment, the\ntone of pity and pious horror and righteous self-\ncomplacency employed by the English press toward\nthis country, is something truly edifying; while their\nsudden and entire blindness to the merits of the\ncase is altogether unexplainable. As we hear such\nviews as those just described, we ask ourselves,\n\" What has the English thinking-mind been doing\nthe last few years, in the consideration of our great\nproblem? Is this all that an educated people can\noffer in intelligent judgment of a grand question of\nhumanity? Is this all that is known of our Gov-\nernment, of slavery, of the struggle against it?\nHave we got to go over every step in the progress\nof American political life and American reform the\nlast fifty years ?\u201d Then, again, remember the elo-\nquent words of denunciation which have rung even\nover the Atlantic, from the ancestral Island, for so\nmany years, at our great public sin; recalling how,\nwhile its guilt lay heavy upon us, the English mind\nchose to consider the nation as one; and now, when\nour whole people are rising and offering blood and\nwealth as if they were water, to lessen and restrain\nthis evil, we are told to keep quiet, that the evil be-\nlongs to the South, and with them should remain-\nwhat can we conclude, as to English sincerity and\nEnglish opposition to slavery?

                    "ocr_text": "a\nLet us recall briefly to our English readers what\nthis war really is. And in the first place, let us\nlave done, once and forever, with the talk about its\nbeing a war of rival tariffs.\nProtection and Free Trade have nothing to do\nwith it. The Protective System originated with\nthe South. Every tariff has passed by Southern\nvotes. There has been no session in which the\nSouth and the (so-called) Free-Trade Democracy\nof the North could not have controlled the legisla-\ntion of Congress. More than two-thirds of the\nFree States are agricultural and commercial, and of\ncourse fully as much inclined to low tariffs as the\nSouth.\nProbably one-half of the Republican party be-\nlieve that the passage of the Morrill Tarifl, at that\nparticular juncture, was a stupendous blunder;\nthough this fact does not diminish our appreciation\nof that morality whose sympathies for a struggle in\nbehalf of Human Rights rise and fall with the scale\nof duties on iron ware and woolen goods.\nWow did this war originate, and what could have\nprevented it? Six months ago, the people of the\nFree States need only have said to the slaveholders,\n\u201cYour slaves are property, in the eye of the Con-\nstitution, and you can take them where you wish!\u201d\nand this whole fearful struggle might have been\nsaved. The Border States were ready to accept\nthis compromise; North Carolina and Arkansas\nwould have probably allowed it; and the few feeble\nGulf States, divided among themselves, would have\nsoon yielded and taken-which was all they could\ndesire-unlimited liberty over a whole continent,\nand through generations yet unborn, to extend\nhuman slavery.\nHere was the crisis. Here, our English friends\nmust remember, was the question to be determined.\nOn one side was offered, slavery made national and\nextended over all that now belongs, or should here-\nafter belong to the United States; and on the other,\nthe legal restriction of slavery and the sustaining\nthe will of the people, as manifested in the election\nof an administration opposed to slavery. Every one\nsaw that the choice was between universal slavery\nand the awful chance of civil war and rebellion.\nAnd to the glory evermore of our Anglo-American\nrace, be it said, we deliberately and quietly chose\nthe latter. Henceforward, there was but one course\npossible: the putting down the rebellion, sustaining\nthe Government, and holding slavery in with the\niron hand. The apparent weakness and vacilla-\ntion of the Administration was due partly to the\nconsciousness of strength, and partly to the deep\nconviction at the North that the South would yet\nreturn to its allegiance.\nTo the question put so often by Englishmen,\nWhy not let them go?\u201d an American finds it diffi-\ncult to answer with proper patience.\nWe certainly believe in \u201c government resting on\nthe consent of the governed,\u201d but it is not a neces-\nsary corollary that discontent dissolves the Govern-\nment. The governed, under our Constitution, must\nchange their rule in a legal, constitutional, assigned\nmode. Our Charter has provided the method of\nalteration for a dissatisfied minority.\nTo \" let the South go,\" is utterly impossible; not\nbecause we need their cotton, or their territory, or\ntheir population, or their civilization, but simply be-\ncause then we should have to \u201clet everything go.\u201d\nNew York might \u201cgo\u201d from New England;\nPennsylvania separate from Wisconsin ; Staten\nIsland from New York City, and Five Points se-\ncede from the Metropolitan Police District. In\nother words, it is simply anarchy. Besides, separa-\ntion is civil war dragged along for generations: war\nfor frontiers, war for territories, for the Mississippi,\nfor the Potomac, for the Tortugas, for Key West,\nfor the Gulf; war for and against slavery. All that\nnow urges to arms, and tenfold more, would be\nspurring on these two confederacies to incessant\nhostilities. Still more, slavery would go forth with\nits piratical flag over all the islands and the new\nprovinces of the Southern hemisphere.\nA republic would then rear its arrogant head,\nconfessedly based on human slavery, and whose\ngreat design would be to extend over new fields\nand through unknown centuries the infinite wrongs\nand cruelties and degradation of American chattel-\nhood.\nIs not war, English friends! civil war, fratricidal\nwar, better than this?\nWe must, of course, admit that there are difficul-\nties of a most formidable nature, as to the final set-\ntlement of this question with the South\u2014such as\nrelate to the peculiar form of our Government and\nthe dangers from military successes and standing\narmies. Without discussing these, we can only say\nhere that they are less, by far, than the dangers and\ndifficulties from any peaceable secession-and of\nthese, we are the best judges.-N. Y.

                    "ocr_text": "up\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE SLAVES\nEMANCIPATED BY WAR?\nThe popular instinct, which goes right to the trut\nof the matter, says, \u201c Slavery made the war; let i\ntake the consequences of war.\u201d We expect tha\nnothing more just than that could be proclaimed\nfrom Sinai itself. But politicians in office have bu\nlittle faith either in the popular instinct or in eterna\njustice. Why should men, who are conscious o\ntheir own weakness, have faith in the popular in-\nstinct which elevated them to office? Therefore\nthe question with them is, how to avoid these great\nself-evident truths. To this want of faith is added\nanother demoralizing element, in the common po-\nlitical idea that the more that truth and justice are\nviolated, the better our constitutional obligations are\nfulfilled; and that the sacrifice of the great popular\ninstinct of truth is a patriotic sacrifice to the coun-\ntry.\nHeaven help a country where to crush out the\ninstincts of right, and to sacrifice manhood, is set\nup as patriotism ;\u2014that is, nothing but Heaven\ncould save such a country, but it would not be\nworth saving. How much better would such a\npeople be than those who set up the most hideous\nreptiles and all manner of beastliness as objects of\nworship?\nIs the Government which we are supporting a\nlegitimate, constitutional and just Government?\nThen to rebel against it is the greatest crime known\nto humanity. It is guilt for all the horrors of the\nwar. It is the sum of all iniquity, for it includes\nall possible crimes. The rebels have forfeited all\nright to life, liberty and property, and only hold\neither at the mercy of the Government, after com-\nplete submission. This is the natural and universal\nlaw of all ages and Governments. They who take\nthe sword must perish by the sword.\nAre we to carry on this war as if it was for a just\ngovernment against rebellion ? Are we justified in\nusing the most efficient means to crush rebellion ?\nHave we even belligerent rights? Or is it only\nanother and a desperate effort to fulfill what, in the\nslavishness in which the people of the North have\nwallowed until it has become second nature, is\ncalled \u201c\nour obligations to the South\u201d? We ask\nthis, because so far our attitude in this war seems to\nindicate this motive. Our citizens are robbed of\ntheir dues, property and ships, themselves abused\nwith more than savage ferocity, and hundreds of\nthem murdered-hundreds of millions of Northern\ninvestments swept out of existence by Southern\nrascality, our industry destroyed, the very exist-\nence of the government threatened by the rebel-\nlion; yet our brave volunteers, who have tendered\ntheir lives to save their country, and to show that\nthey have a country worthy of the lives of its citi-\nzens, are informed at the outset of the campaign\nthat their first duty is to catch fugitive slaves for\nrebel masters, and suppress black insurrections for\nwhite insurgents. Three great Generals, in com-\nmand of three great corps of the grand army of\nthe North, have successively proclaimed this degra-\ndation to the nation. And fugitives in the very\nCapital, flying from masters who had plotted its\ndestruction, to the soldiers of the government for\nprotection, have been stopped by their bayonets, and\ndelivered up to masters who would gladly have assas-\nsinated every one of our men with steel or poison.\nIs it only an enlarged slave hunt that the North\nis called to carry on with such generous, patriotic\nsacrifices ? Disgusted with the degrading work\nwhich he had assumed, a Democratic General took\nthe responsibility of holding the fugitive slaves of\nrebels as contraband of war. His report of this\ncourse brought a diplomatic, non-committal reply,\ninstructing the General to keep an account of the\nlabor of the fugitives; as if the government would\nhave it understood that it might be held accountable\nfor the fugitive slaves that sought refuge in its\ncamps. And whom would it imply that it might be\nheld responsible to? To their rebel masters, of\ncourse; who else would have\nany claim\ngovernment for them ?\nNow we are told, from day to day, that the Cabi-\nnet is in consultation over this question, and has\nfailed, so far, to come to any conclusion. In the\nmeantime, our troops are met at every point by\nformidable fortifications, thrown up by these very\nslaves who are held in service solely by the impression\nwhich has been spread among them by the fugitives\nwho have been returned by our army, that flight\nto it will result in return to torture, and to be sold\nSouth. From behind these fortifications, mounted\nby the same labor, with abundance of great guns,\nrobbed from the government, the insurgents slaugh-\nter our soldiers, who are thus made to furnish the\nenemy with the most effective and deadly means of\nattacking them.\nIn every way by which the army can enter Vir-\nginia, it is met by these murderous fortifications,\nprovided by the labor over which our troops virtually\nstand as overseers and slave-drivers. Has our great\narmy entered Virginia for nothing but to furnish\naid and comfort to its deadly foes? Has the gov-\nernment any more right to commit treason by\nfurnishing aid and comfort to the enemy, than any\nof its subjects? How can it take any measures to\npunish treason, when it sets an example of the most\neffective and dangerous treason? Under the pres-\nent strategic campaign, every slave is a more val-\nuable soldier to the insurgents than a white soldier\nof the average Southern stock. Their muscle and\nendurance throw up the fortifications which add\nten-fold to the power of their troops. Their labor\nperforms all the heavy work of mounting the great\nguns, and of forage and transportation, which is so\nsevere on soldiers when added to their other duties.\nWhat right has the government thus to strengthen\nthe rebellion ? Are these blacks property? Then\nit is subject to the fate of all property used for mili-\ntary purposes in time of war. Even if not used for\nmilitary purposes, it is subject to the fate of other\nproperty. Is it any more sacred than the ships,\nsteamboats and goods of Northern citizens, which\nthe rebels have seized and confiscated, wherever\nthey could lay hands on them? If property, the\nslaves must be treated as the property of rebels, the\nmost valuable for military purposes. If men, they\nare the most formidable allies and soldiers of the\nrebels, and our government would be justified in\nusing all possible means to detach them from the\nrebel service. When they escape to our army, they\nare fugitives from the enemy, and no nation can\ndeliver up such without the guilt of treachery.\nWhen they reach our camps, they are men. The\ngovernment can know them in no other capacity.\nThe government cannot become a slaveholder. It\ncan only know them as men, with all the rights of\nmen, and with the additional claim of having joined\nthe government in a war against rebellion. By\nwhat right can we deliver them up, if disposed to\ndo so treacherous an act? By the Fugitive Slave\nLaw? That the seceders have abolished. What\nseceded or neutral State can claim anything under\nFederal obligations? They pretend that their soil\nis violated by the exercise of any Federal authority\nupon it. Why should the government force the Fu-\ngitive Slave Law on an unwilling and hostile people?\nupon the The United States Constitution is \"a covenant\nwith death, and an agreement with hell.\"\n\" What order of men under the most absolute of\nmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republice, was ever\ninvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that\nof the separate and exclusive representation of less than\nhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,\nin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential man-\nsion? This investment of power in the owners of one\nspecies of property concentrated in the highest authorities\nof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged\norder of men in the community, more adverse to the rights\nof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,\nthan any order of nobility ever known. To call govern-\nment thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the under-\nstanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the\ninfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in\nthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it-\nno model in the records of ancient history, or in the politi-\ncal theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States\nby an equivocation--a representation of property under the\nname of persons. Little did the members of the Conven-\ntion from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacri-\nfice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this conces-\nsion.\u201d\u2014John QUINCY ADAMS.",

In the na-\nture of the case, it can only be for the traitors that\nwe have assumed the duties of slave-driver and\nslaye-catcher-a business regarded as degraded by\nthe slaveholders themselves, but which our brave\nvolunteers, who have offered life, fortune and honor\nin the service of their country, are called upon to\ncarry on for the very men who are fighting against\nthem with all the resorts of the assassin.\nThe rebels boasted from the outbreak of the re-\nbellion, that they could carry on the war without\nexhaustion, for their slaves would do the agricul-\ntural labor while the whites did the fighting. It is\nhardly probable that they expected the government\nto assist them in carrying this out; but our North-\nern men who have left their fields and shops to de-\nfend the government, or who have been cut off from\nlabor by the war, are informed that their first duty\nis to keep\nthe slaves of the rebels at work, while\ntheir masters are carrying on the war.\nNo war can\nbe carried on successfully which begin\nsition so demoralizing to the troops. coellion\ncan ever be suppressed which the government first\nsets up as more sacred than itself; nor ought a re-\nbellion to be conquered by a government which\nrecognizes it as sacred.\nIf our government intends to carry on the war,\nit is high time for it to assume belligerent rights.\nSo far, it has been done as if the Jeff. Davis insur-\nrection had the divine right of government, and we\nwere the rebels. They plunder our citizens, lynch\nand murder them, and we hasten to turn the other\ncheek by offering to keep the negro property in\nsubjection. They forbid our men-of-war to enter\nPensacola harbor, and the men-of-war meekly take\npost outside, and for months witness the passage in\nand out of vessels laden with supplies for the rebel\ntroops. Their privateers steal out of their ports,\nand capture our merchant vessels, while our ships-\nof-war have at length become so bold as to turn\nback vessels laden with supplies for Bragg's troops,\nand forbid them to enter. At the last accounts, an\nUnited States officer tried hard to induce a rebel\ncaptain, who had been stopped with a cargo of lum-\nber, to sell it at an exorbitant price to the govern-\nment, for the troops on Santa Rosas Island; but he\nrefused, and was turned back with his cargo.\nA guerrilla war is waged on our outposts in Vir-\nginia, and our sentinels stolen upon in the darkness\nand shot down. Sometimes the assassin is taken.\nThen he becomes a prisoner of war, and in due\ntime is exchanged, or disemon tali the oath\nof allegiance, to go on shooting our sentino..\nBy the principle of war, every individual of the\nhostile people is at war, and is responsible in life\nand property. Modern Warfare has, to some ex-\ntent, ameliorated this by sparing private property,\nand the persons of those not actually combatant.\nBut this is conceded only on the ground that the\nhostile inhabitants are peaceable, and do not molest\nthe troops. If they do, they are liable to every\npenalty of war, both in person and property, and\nwar does not admit of nice discriminations.\nThe guerrilla assassination of our troops every-\nwhere in Virginia would justify, according to the\nmost humane rules of war, the severest retaliation\nupon the inhabitants and their property. But the\nmore they shoot our pickets, the more we strive to\nshow our regard for the sanctity of their persons\nand property; and the severest penalties are in-\nflicted on the soldiers of the government who have\nexercised a soldier's right to plunder armed ene-\nmies,\nThe result of this course is seen in Virginia and\neverywhere in the infected districts. Rebellion is\nthe safest business now carried on in the country.\nIts consequences are a farce - a mere joke-an\noath. What can be a richer joke to a Southern\nrebel than an oath of allegiance ? Our army holds\nno more ground than its bayonets cover. Pickets of\nthe rebels everywhere surround it with impunity,\ncutting it off from intelligence, building batteries\nunder its very guns, setting ambushes, and amusing\nthemselves by picking off our sentinels. If they\nare taken, it ends as a joke.\nOur President proclaims that rebel privateers will\nbe treated as pirates, and we growl at England be-\ncause she does not proclaim the same. But a rebel\nprivateer is taken, and her crew, instead of being\nsuspended at once to the yard-arm, are brought to\nNew York to take advantage of the law's delay,\nand the glorious right of trial by jury, with the\nchance of aid from some judicial traitor, by one of\nwhom the Administration has already been cowed.\nFrom the Atlantic to the Mississippi, supplies are\ncontinually transported from the North to the rebel\narmy, and the government resorts to no efficient\nmeasures to prevent; but, on the other hand, is\nquoted by conditional rebels as indorsing a neu-\ntrality which is protecting and supplying the rebel\narmy, and doing more to aid it and destroy the gov-\nernment, than could be done by its active hostility.\nThe war has never yet been recognized as an\nexisting fact, by our side. We have endured every\nact of war as if it was a right which belonged to\nthe rebels. It may be that nothing but some serious\ndisaster to our cause will establish just distinctions,\nand force us to the exercise of belligerent rights.\nBut if we have not a right to crush this rebellion as\na crime, and to hang the ringleaders as traitors, we\nhave no right to resort to force at all. If they have\nthe right to make war upon the government, and\nare nothing but prisoners of war when taken, then\ntheir independent rights are conceded, and we have\nno right to carry on the war on our part. The\npresent treatment does nothing but strengthen und\nextend the rebellion. Until our forces treat the\nrebellion as treason, and resort to every belligerent\nright to cripple its power and crush it into submis-\nsion by every penalty of war, we shall make no\nprogress against it.-Cincinnati Gazette.\na\nWASHINGTON, June 11th.\nThree slaves were\ntaken into one of the camps yesterday. A Mr.\nWebb, of Virginia, claimed to be their owner, and\ndemanded them. The Colonel refused, deeming\nthem contraband.

It is\nhardly probable that they expected the government\nto assist them in carrying this out; but our North-\nern men who have left their fields and shops to de-\nfend the government, or who have been cut off from\nlabor by the war, are informed that their first duty\nis to keep the slaves of the rebels at work, while\ntheir masters are carrying on the war.\nNo war can\nbe carried on successfully which begin\nsition so demoralizing to the troops. ellion\ncan ever be suppressed which the government first\nsets up as more sacred than itself; nor ought a re-\nbellion to be conquered by a government which\nrecognizes it as sacred.\nIf our government intends to carry on the war,\nit is high time for it to assume belligerent rights.\nSo far, it has been done as if the Jeff. Davis insur-\nrection had the divine right of government, and we\nwere the rebels. They plunder our citizens, lynch\nand murder them, and we hasten to turn the other\ncheek by offering to keep the negro property in\nsubjection. They forbid our men-of-war to enter\nPensacola harbor, and the men-of-war meekly take\npost outside, and for months witness the passage in\nand out of vessels laden with supplies for the rebel\ntroops. Their privateers steal out of their ports,\nand capture our merchant vessels, while our ships-\nof-war have at length become so bold as to turn\nback vessels laden with supplies for Bragg's troops,\nand forbid them to enter. At the last accounts, an\nUnited States officer tried hard to induce a rebel\ncaptain, who had been stopped with a cargo of lum-\nber, to sell it at an exorbitant price to the govern-\nment, for the troops on Santa Rosas Island; but he\nrefused, and was turned back with his cargo.\nA guerrilla war is waged on our outposts in Vir-\nginia, and our sentinels stolen upon in the darkness\nand shot down. Sometimes the assassin is taken.\nThen he becomes a prisoner of war, and in due\ntime is exchanged, or disemon tali the oath\nof allegiance, to go on shooting our sentimosain.\nBy the principle of war, every individual of the\nhostile people is at war, and is responsible in life\nand property. Modern Warfare has, to some ex-\ntent, ameliorated this by sparing private property,\nand the persons of those not actually combatant.\nBut this is conceded only on the ground that the\nhostile inhabitants are peaceable, and do not molest\nthe troops. If they do, they are liable to every\npenalty of war, both in person and property, and\nwar does not admit of nice discriminations.\nThe guerrilla assassination of our troops every-\nwhere in Virginia would justify, according to the\nmost humane rules of war, the severest retaliation\nupon the inhabitants and their property. But the\nmore they shoot our pickets, the more we strive to\nshow our regard for the sanctity of their persons\nand property; and the severest penalties are in-\nflicted on the soldiers of the government who have\nexercised a soldier's right to plunder armed ene-\nmies,\nThe result of this course is seen in Virginia and\neverywhere in the infected districts. Rebellion is\nthe safest business now carried on in the country.\nIts consequences are a farce - a mere joke-an\noath. What can be a richer joke to a Southern\nrebel than an oath of allegiance ? Our army holds\nno more ground than its bayonets cover. Pickets of\nthe rebels everywhere surround it with impunity,\ncutting it off from intelligence, building batteries\nunder its very guns, setting ambushes, and amusing\nthemselves by picking off our sentinels. If they\nare taken, it ends as a joke.\nOur President proclaims that rebel privateers will\nbe treated as pirates, and we growl at England be-\ncause she does not proclaim the same. But a rebel\nprivateer is taken, and her crew, instead of being\nsuspended at once to the yard-arm, are brought to\nNew York to take advantage of the law's delay,\nand the glorious right of trial by jury, with the\nchance of aid from some judicial traitor, by one of\nwhom the Administration has already been cowed.\nFrom the Atlantic to the Mississippi, supplies are\ncontinually transported from the North to the rebel\narmy, and the government resorts to no efficient\nmeasures to prevent; but, on the other hand, is\nquoted by conditional rebels as indorsing a neu-\ntrality which is protecting and supplying the rebel\narmy, and doing more to aid it and destroy the gov-\nernment, than could be done by its active hostility.\nThe war has never yet been recognized as an\nexisting fact, by our side. We have endured every\nact of war as if it was a right which belonged to\nthe rebels. It may be that nothing but some serious\ndisaster to our cause will establish just distinctions,\nand force us to the exercise of belligerent rights.\nBut if we have not a right to crush this rebellion as\na crime, and to hang the ringleaders as traitors, we\nhave no right to resort to force at all. If they have\nthe right to make war upon the government, and\nare nothing but prisoners of war when taken, then\ntheir independent rights are conceded, and we have\nno right to carry on the war on our part. The\npresent treatment does nothing but strengthen und\nextend the rebellion. Until our forces treat the\nrebellion as treason, and resort to every belligerent\nright to cripple its power and crush it into submis-\nsion by every penalty of war, we shall make no\nprogress against it.--Cincinnati Gazette.\na\nWASHINGTON, June 11th.\nThree slaves were\ntaken into one of the camps yesterday. A Mr.\nWebb, of Virginia, claimed to be their owner, and\ndemanded them. The Colonel refused, deeming\nthem contraband. They were sent over to General\nSandford's quarters, upon his order, where Webb\nagain presented himself, and General Sandford sent\nfor a wagon at his own expense, into which the three\nnegroes were placed, and sent back to Virginia, to\nthe entire satisfaction of their secession master. This\nact on General Sandford's part has given rise to\nmuch comment to-day, and he gets very little credit\nin any quarter, save among the rebel slave-owners\nover the river.",

The moral conflict that is going on\namong you between the mistaken interests, the dar\nand erring passions and prejudices of the human\nheart, and the glorious aitributes that tend to exal\nand dignify man and promote human happiness\ncannot but prove of vast importance in its results 1\nyourselves\u2014to your southern brethren\u2014to this whol\nhemisphere-and remotely to the whole world.\n\u00c0 conviction that you are disposed patiently to in\nvestigate and weigh the various and conflicting pro\njects that may be offered for the removal of the ap\npalling evils under which you labor, encourages m\nto offer some views for your\nconsideration.\nMany estimable individuals have proposed seve\nal plans of colonization as offering, in their opinion\nthe best means of relief, viz. removal to Liberia, t\nHayti, Texas, Canada, &c. It inay be right tha\nthese channels remain open to the voluntary, unin\nfluenced choice of those to whom they are offered\nyet, if carried to any great extent, it is my full con\nviction that such removals would be attended wit\nan enormous waste of valuable lives, and be of in\ncalculable injury to the Planters, to the Unite\nStates, and to the slaves themselves; all which\nshall endeavor to prove.\nNot knowing accurately the amount exported\nthe agricultural products of the slave States, let u\ncall them twenty-five millions of dollars annually\nTake away the laborers who produce these, an\nwho shall supply their places ? Can the planter\nand their sons ? Impossible! With as great\nchange of habit as necessity itself could urge, al\nthat they could raise for years to come would affor\nbut a scanty subsistence for themselves and familie\n-the bare necessaries of life, with nothing to ex\nport. Should we seek to fill the vacancy by the im\nportation of Irish laborers, one half of these woule\nprobably perish in the two first seasons : moreover\nthey would unquestionably be more intemperate\nmore turbulent and less effective hands than a like\nnumber of free blacks. The writer of these line\nknows this from experience, having during the las\ntwenty years frequently employed both in agricul\ntural pursuits ; and he has uniforinly been more\nfaithfully and profitably served by those who hac\nescaped from slavery in the South, than from the\nother class. He has therefore become fully convinc-\ned, that nothing is wanted but to change the char-\nacter of your laboring population from slave to free\nord the more instantaneously this is done, the bet-\nter ; a corresponding change in our treatment o\nthem would of course follow.\n\u2022 But,' says your intelligent statesmen, our re-\nliance is on diverting to the south the current of emi-\ngration that is now powerfully setting from the north-\nern and eastern to the western states.' This migh\npossibly, in some degree, be attainable ; but, in the\nfirst place, it would retard advancement in the west\nSecondly, northing short of an immense depreciation\nof property in the south would tempt this descrip-\ntion of emigrants to remove among you. Thirdly.\nnot being accustomed to subordination to individuals\nbut only to the laws, they would remove mostly as\nindependent settlers. Fourthly, should any of them\nhire to you as laborers, they would expect such ad-\nditional compensation on account of the unhealthi-\nness and fatigue incident to warm climates, as would\nsoon enable them to supplant you as owners of the\nsoil. A great proportion of these would, however,\nperish in the seasoning. And fiftbly, the sagacity of\nthe survivors would soon enable them to discover\nthat it would be to their interest to invite back the\nvery same free negroes that you had banished, as\nthey would undoubtedly be the best and most profit-\nable hands that could be employed in those climates\nThus it appears that\n1st. The millions to be expended in their removal\nmay yet be saved.\n2nd. The twenty-five millions that they now an-\nnually produce may be saved.\n3d. The thousands of lives to be sacrificed in their\ndeportation and acclimation in foreign lands may be\ngaved.\n4th. The expense of re-importing them may be\nsaved.\n5th. Another loss of life in re-acclimation may be\nsaved.\n6th The sacrifice of the lives of a large body of\neastern or other emigrants may be saved.\n7th. The wretchedness consequent on the im.\nmense depreciation of your property, and the trans-\nfer of it into other bands, may be saved.\nSth. An incalculable loss of character may be\nsaved, and the western states may be permitted to\ngo on receiving their wonted stream of healthful\nemigration.\nIt may bo well, too, to reflect a little on the risk\nthat attends the expalsion of the colored population ;\nfor they will not willingly expatriate theniselves.\nThe free blacks, it does not appear, have been at all\nimplieated in the recent insurrection in Virginia ;\nthey have, in fact, formed a barrier between the\nslaves and their masters ; but measures have been\ntaken that will almost compel them to identify\nthemselves with the slaves in some effort to attain\ntheir rights--for they are cruelly persecuted and\ndriven from State to State, with no where to lay\ntheir heads.\nThe more ignorant any person is, the stronger are\nhis local attachments. Ten miles square to a man,\nwho has never been beyond those limits, is all the\nworld to him : drive him from this spot, and his\nlonginys to return are almost irresistible.\nNorth and South America and the West Indies\ncontain, from the best information we can obtain,\ninore than twelve millions of colored people. Could\nthe two million five hundred thousand in the United\nStates be expelled from thence, the great majority\nof them would doubtless mingle with their nearest\nsurrounding brethren ; and, smarting under their\nwrongs, and at liberty to proclaim them, we may\nwell imagine what effect their representations would\nhave on these twelve millions whom we had also\nmade our enemies, by laws, that every one who\ncould tell his right hand from his left knew to be a-\nbominably unjust. Contests arising from our repeat-\ned and unprovoked aggressions seem unavoidable ;\nand should an invasion on their part promise any",

D. 1832.\nThat on Wednesday evening, the 29th day of Feb-\nruary last, he left the house of Thomas Porter, in\nVine street, No. 54, between the hours of 6 and 7\no'clock in the evening ; that he was about turning\ninto Coates alley, not quite a square from Mr. Por-\nter's house, when he was seized by two nien; that\nthey put a plaister over his mouth and held both bis\nhands, and took bim down Front street to Market\nstreet, and then put him on board a sloop at the\nlower side of Market street whar\u017f; that they put\nhim down into the hold of ihe sloop, took the plais-\nter from his mouth, and told him if he made a noise\nor hallooed they would knock out his brains; that\nthey pushed off the sloop immediately and went\ndown the river ; that they arrived at Delaware City\nabout 12 o'clock at night ; that there was a black\nman in the hold with him ; that the sloop was made\n3\nfast to the wharf, and he heard the men say that they\nwould go to the tavern and get something to drink ;\nthat after the men had gone, this deponent and the\nblack nan broke open the hatchway and came on\ndeck, got upon the wharf and ran off as fast as they\ncould ; that about 3 o'clock on the morning of Fri-\nday they got to Wilmington, and that they both\ncame to the city on Friday in the Wilmington stean-\nboat. That while on board the sloop he heard the\nsay,\n. we have got these two fellows tight e-\nnough.' That the black man told deponent he lived\nin Shippen street, and had there a wife and three\nchildren ; that the black man told him he was\nbrought to the sloop in the same way that the depo-\nnent was brought there ; that on the way from Del-\naware City they stopped at a house where some\ncolored people lived, and stayed there some hours ;\nthat they were travelling all day on Thursday. That\nthe men who took .bm had on black dresses and\nchecked shirts ; that they had on long coats and\nblack hats ; that when they put him into the hold\nthey took off the plaister from his mouth; that he\nobserved nothing in the hold of the vessel ; that\nthey had no light ; that when himself and the black\nman made their escape, he first knew his companion\nto be black ; that the black man did not tell his\nname.\nJAMES C.

Z.\n-, Sept. Sth, 1831.\nMy dear friend\u2014I am sorry you should have\nthought me weary of a subject that ought to interest\nevery mind ; so far from being tired of your conver-\nsation, I have hardly dismissed it from my thoughts\nsince we parted, and am astonished now that my\nsense of justice has not bitherto been more strongly\nroused by wrongs inflicted on a race, who have al-\nways interested my heart. I wonder that on our\nnational festivals, when surveying our beautiful coun-\ntry, our free institutions, our happy citizens, I have\nnot dwelt with deeper sympathy on the misfortunes\nof the colored people, that much injured portion of\nmy\nfellow countrymen.\nI was led in the course of a long walk a few days\nago, to a train of sad reflections on the inward, the\nmental state of female slaves. Strolling through a\nretired road, I noticed a hovel built in the roughest\nmanner and of the coarsest materials. The confined\ndiniensions, rude chimney, and narrow broken win-\ndows, all marked it out as the dwelling-place of ex-\ntreme poverty. The only door stood wide open,\nand displayed the wretchedness within that the exte-\nrior had indicated. I at once recognized it as the\nabode of a woman, by the articles of female dress\nwhich hung round the room, and was pleased to no-\ntice the little library arranged upon a broken chair.\nIndeed the sadness inspired by the appearance of so\nmuch external want, was relieved at once by the\nsight of the books. What boundless treasure, thought\nI, may those old volumes pour into the mind of the\npossessor! What glories may they open to her\nmental vision! What is this miserable habitation-\nwhat this seclusion from society, if the mind has\nbeen stored with pure thoughts and ennobled with\ngenerous sentiments? Then recurring to the sub-\njeci which had previously occupied me, in proportion\nas I was consoled by this cheering view of poverty\nalleviated, my feelings sunkon recollecting the\nsituation of the unhappy female slaves whose sor-\nlows and toil receive no alleviations from intellectual\nTheir situation,--alas ! I cannot picture\nit to my imagination ; for the very power of dwel-\nJing on this subject, of extending my thoughts beyond\nthe narrow circle of sensible objects, precludes the\npossibility of conceiving the degree of suffering en-\ndured by an uncultivated human being condemned\n10 unceasing labor. Forced from the exciting en-\ndearments and occupations of domestic life, without\nan idea for the mind to feed on, foreign to a dull\nround of irksome, inappropriate toil-Oh, sad condi-\ntion !-The heart sickens when the vilest criminal\nis justly deprived of freedom, and east upon his own\nresources. unfurnished mind. And is it possible that so many\nof my innocent countrywomen are suffering what\nlegislators have devised as a punishment for crime?\nThe absorbing sympathies, the quickening interests,\nthe animating variety of domestic life, all closed\nupon them ; the action of the heart checked-de-\nstroyed--that propelling action, which serves, in\nsome measure, amongst the free, to supply the want\nof mental culture, by keeping up a motion in the\nintellectual faculties ; particularly in a race upon\nwhom nature has bestowed peculiar susceptibility.\nThis influence of the affections on the powers of\nthe mind, I have seen remarkably exemplified in a\nservant or rather friend of our family.\nS. D.... when my grandmother received her\ninto service, was an inoffensive child, with no ex-\ntraordinary bodily or mental vigor. She was taught\nto read, and received with great attention the relig-\nious instruction that was carefully imparted, apply-\ning the precepts of christianity 10 her own heart and\nlife with a prompiness and simplicity truly exempla-\nry. Her humble duties were so regularly perform-\ned, she was so constantly at her post, so quiet, per-\nsevering, kind and gentle, that she soon became not\nonly dear to my grand parents, but to the numerous\nbranches of the family who were occasional visitors\nat the house. Few came who did not early seek an\ninterview with S. The welcome at the old pater-\nnal mansion was not quite complete without her\nsmile and pleasant greeting. Years passed on, and\nin their course brought those vicissitudes to which\nevery family is more or less subject. S. alone seem-\ned stationary. To a common observer she under-\nwent no change ; but her mind was ripening through\nthe intensity of her sympathy. So much did she\nenter into the feelings of others, and identify herself\nwith every member of the family, that she has had\nlarge experience and has grown wise through the\ntenderness of her heart. Her judgment on moral\nsubjects is excellent ; and, if I could divest her of an\ninclination to indulge me too much, I should con-\nsider her a very safe casuist. It is wonderful to see\nthe influence she obtains over children, and those\nengaged with her in household duties. I have smiled\nsometimes at the perfect efficiency of her low toned\nvoice to reduce to obedience an unruly boy. Her\ngoodness is so true, her kindness so sincere, that her\nunderstanding catches light from her emotions. She\nknows how to say and do by a glance that which it\nwould take many books to teach. But her under-\nstanding never appears to greater advantage, than in\nthe meek dignity with which she overcomes con.\ntempt. The laborers on my grand-father's farm,\nwhen employed from distant towns,--for S. is hon-\nored where she is known,-seeing themselves served\nby a colored woman, would often begin with ridicu-\nling her, and calling contemptuously upon her servi-\nces; but a few days always changed their manner to\na respectful kindness, and in some instances to a\nconfidential communication of secret sorrows, temp-\ntations, resolutions, &c. which proved the strong\nimpression made by her character on even the rud-\nest and most uncultivated. Piety and benevolence\nhave so refined and ennobled her mind, that she is\nindeed almost insensible to any personal disadvan-\ntage arising from her color ; but she feels the evil\non higher, inore disinterested principles, with deep\nWhen I spoke to her once on the subject\nshe replied, \" I have feared that the great distinction\nwhich is inade would be injurious to the cause of re-\nligion, when I have noticed it even at the table of\nour Lord, and on that solemn occasion, when the\nbody is committed to the earth.' At a time, she\nmeant to say, when it is expected that the value of\nevery thing external will disappear, and be lost in\nthe thought of that period when the body will be\nglorified only in proportion as the soul has been foru-\ned to the image of Jesus.\nI could write much more on this subject, but have\nonly time to add that I am ever your affectionate\nconcern.\nGrond",

B. a citizen of New-York, was re-\nturning from Albany in the year 1818 or 1819, in\nthe stage-coach, they were overturned, and he was\nso much hurt as to render him unable to proceed :\nhe therefore remained at a house about twenty\nmiles from the city. Not long after his fellow-\ntravellers had left him, a man by the name of\nHoward, with two little black boys in a covered\nsleigh, stopped at the door ; and our traveller\nfeeling sutficiently recovered from his hurt to pro-\nceed on his journey in an easy way, requested\nHoward to allow him to take a seat in his sleigh,\nand accompany him to New-York, whither he\ntold him he was going.\nHis request was at first refused, but after much\npersuasion and an offer of payment for the trouble,\nhe was permitted to bear them company. On\nleaving the house, one of the boys was placed on\nthe back of the sleigh, (perhaps because their con-\nversation might betray the wicked purposes of\ntheir master,) and this boy being often called to,\nwere circumstances which created suspicion that\nall was not right. They had not gone far, before\nthe boy was missing ; and Howard going back to\nlook for him, gave B. an opportunity to ask the\nother boy some questions ; from whose answers\nhe plainly perceived that the design was to take\nthem to the southern states, for the purpose of\nselling them.\nThe hoy being soon found, they proceeded\nquietly along till near evening, when they reach-\ned the city. B. being left at his own house, he\nsent a person after Howard, to see where he put\nup; but instead of going to a livery stable, as he\nsaid he should, he went directly to the ferry, at\nPowles Hook, and crossed. This information was\ncommunicated by B. to some of the members of\nthe Manumission Society, and two of them, C.\nM. and S. W. who were of the standing commit-\ntee, were, next morning, though it was a severe\nsnow-storm, at the ferry before daylight, and\ncrossing as soon as they could, pursued him sev-\neral miles on the post road to Philadelphia ; but\nfinding on inquiry, that he had turned off into a\nby-way, they followed and overtook him, after\ntravelling several miles further.\nAt the house where he had put up, he appear-\ned to be very familiar, and said he had been fre-\nquently there, on his way to and from Washing-\nton. Being informed that he had violated the\nlaws of New-York in bringing the boys away,\nand that he must return with them, he made many\nexcuses ; but they were not sufficient, and they\nall returned together.\nIt appeared, however, on examination of both\nHoward and the boys, that they were going by\ntheir own consent ; therefore after a severe rep-\nrimand, and Howard had left money to pay the\npassage of one of them in the stage-coach back to\nthe place of his residence, he was sufferel to de-\npart. The other, named John Jackson, is a near\nconnexion of Peter Williams's wife, in this city.\nThis one was soon sent to sea, and has followed\nthat employment ever since ; the other soon re-\nturned home. They were both taken to P. W's\nhouse, where they remained some days.\nFrom the boys' account, it appears that one of\nthem had run away from his master in Connecti-\ncut, and had gone to Peekskill, where the other\nlived. There Howard meeting with them, told\nthem of many fine and curious things to be seen\nat Washington, to which place he was going, and\nwhither he would carry them, free of expense.\nWhen they passed through the city, he told\nthem they must lie close in the bottom of the\nsleigh, for fear they would be taken away, and\nkept as chimney-sweepers.\nThey were so entirely deceived by his promis-\nes, and so pleased with the prospect he held out\nto them, that they could scarcely be persuaded to\nquit his company, even when their danger was\nstated to them.-Poor boys! they did not know\nthe miserable state to which this base man was\nleading them.-Mott's Sketches.",

Several gentlemen who\nwere present on that occasion, drew inferences\nfrom Mr L's remarks similar to my own. After\nstating the argument of southern men-stealers,\nrelative to teaching the slaves to read the bible,\nhe added, if my memory be accurate,- Now,\nMr President, I, for one, am not prepared to wit-\nness this state of things.' The meaning of this\ndeclaration I construed as follows: \u201cAs a lover\nof peace, Mr President, and a discourager of ser-\nvile insurrections, I am not prepared to see the\nslaves possess that knowledge which alone is\nwanting to induce them to perpetrate acts of tar-\nbarity and retaliation, at which humanity must\nshudder.' Mr Ladd declares that, if placed in the\nslaveholder's dilemma, he should not hesitate a\nmoment, but should give the slave the gospel,\nand with the gospel would give him liberty. He\nalso concedes that we have no right to keep our\nfellow creatures in bondage a single minute.'\nThis is certainly different ground from that which\nhe took in his speech ; else I shall not dare here-\nafter to trust my ears, or those of others. I un-\nderstood him expressly to say, that, while he en-\ntertained the utmost respect for those who urged\nthe immediate abolition of slavery, he could not\ncountenance such a measure, and should depre-\ncate its success as fraught with danger to the\ncountry. I understood him to give as a reason\nwhy immediate abolition was impractical.le, that\nmen sometimes wander so far from the path of\nrectitude as to render further aberrations necessa-\nry to get into it-or, in other words, that circum-\nstances sometimes oblige us to continue to do e-\nvil, in order to cure the evil which we are doing.\nTwo clergymen who heard his remarks, under-\nstood him to have made this dangerous admis-\nsion. I am now convinced that he did not mean\nto leave any such impression upon the minds of\nhis audience ; but he, was most unfortunate in\nchoosing his language. I did not take any notes\nof his speech ; for sorrow and astonishment bereft\n1 ;\nme of the ability to write.\nNo man has more frequently received my en-\ncomiums than WILLIAM LADD-no man ever\nmore justly deserved praise. I have yet too ex-\nalted an opinion of his head and heart'to be-\nlieve that he will long continue to give his sup-\nport to the Colonization crusade-a crusade which\nembraces all that is dreadful in persecution, or\nvenomous in hate, or vile in detraction, or unjust\nin oppression, or contemptible in fear, or criminal\nin unbelief-a crusade which is the enemy of God\nand man, which is harrying this country to the\nbrink of destruction, and which is shrouding the\nlight of American freedom,\n\u2022 As a hurricane eelipse\nDoth the sun.'\nMR GARRISON:\nOn my return home from Boston, two days a-\ngo, I took up the Liberator, which had been re-\nceived regularly during my absence, and am much\ngrieved io find sentiments attributed to me, which\nI never entertained.\nIn\nyour\n5th number, you say, that some part of\niny speech, at the late anniversary of the Massa-\nchusetts Colonization Society, is unworthy of my\nhead and heart,' &c. I was not much surprised\nat this, knowing that, though we agree in many\nthings, we disagree on the subject of the Coloni-\nzation Society, and that you have heretofore en-\ntertained a much higher opinion of my head and\nheart'than either deserved ; and knowing also\nthat, when we differ from our brethren in only\none point, we are prone to misunderstand, and\ntherefore to misrepresent their opinions-a truth\nof which you yourself have had in your own per-\nson so many proofs, that one would think you\nwould be on your guard against a similar error, at\nleast so far as not to impute to one, of whom you\nhave so often expressed a favorable opinion, sen-\ntiments totally repugnant to religion and philan-\nthropy.\nI was therefore very much surprised at finding,\nin a note on the first page of your 7th number, **\nthat you attributed to me the sentiment, that\nslaves must not be taught to read even the bible,\nbecause, forsooth, then they will read our Decla-\nration of Independence, Fourth-of-July orations,\nand our panegyrics in favor of liberty,' &c. As\nI made that speech with very little premeditation,\nand have no copy of it, I cannot quote my words\nexactly : but the dri\u017ft of my argument was this :\nSlaveholders refuse to manumit their slaves, be-\ncause, say they, they are not in a proper state to\nbe emancipated, on account of their ignorance.\nIf you urge them to teach their slaves to read at\nleast the bible, then they object that, if you\nteach them to read the bible, they will read\nother things. Teach them to read the bible, Sir,\nand they will read our fourth-of-July orations, the\nDeclaration of Independence, our correspondence\nwith the Greeks, and the letters of the\nyoung\nmen of Boston ' to the Poles, and then may come\nover from Hayti some black La Fayette, who will\nlead them on to victory and liberty, and then\nthey will erect monuments and have an indepen-\ndent day of their own. I could hardly have\nthought that my using the words of a slaveholder,\nthough, perhaps, a little exaggerated, would have\nbrought upon me the imputation of their senti-\nments. As well might you, by the same passage,\nmake me approve of insurrection and bloodshed.\nMy object was, to place the slaveholder in a di-\nlemma in which he must either refuse the bible to\nhis slave, or run the risk of insurrection. In that\ndilemma, I should not hesitate a moment, but",

We are not to do evil that good may\nInsurrection and bloodshed, even for lib-\nerty, are condemned by the gospel, and I can-\nnot approve of it, neither do you. The insurrec-\ntion of Southampton, however, has furnished me\nwith an irresistible answer to those captious op-\nposers of the principles of peace, who always\nmake an appeal to the passions, by asking if I\nthink it right to fight for liberty ? In return, I al-\nways ask, if they mean the question to apply to\nblack men as well as white ? and the first ques-\ntion is never repeated. To say that it is right for\nwhite men to fight for liberty, and wrong for\nblacks, and neither right nor wrong for mulattoes,\nor both together, is too absurd to be contemplat-\ned for a moment.\nThere is a natural connexion between all kinds\nof moral good, as there is between all mural e-\nvils. When we get out of the right path, we of-\nten find it difficult to return.\nThe half way\nchristian is often exposed to difficulties which nev-\ner trouble the consistent disciple of Christ. Had\nchristian nations never attempted to settle nation-\nal controversies by the sword, like barbarians, the\nquestion of defensive war would never have aris-\nen. Had christians never enslaved their fellow-\ncreatures, there would have been no question on\nthe subject of immediate emancipation. It is\nself-interest, which blinds the minds of \u00e9ven be-\nnevolent men in the slaveholding states, and\ninakes the oppose immediate emancipation.\nThe interest of the slave is but little attended to.\nWe differ on the subject of Colonization, and\nview it in a very different light. Which of us is\nprejudiced, it is not for either of us to say. But\nthis is no reason why I should impute to you\nunworthy motives. I endeavor to think as well\nof every man as I can. If I err, let it be on the\nside of charity. I would rather disbelieve my\nown ears, than impute unworthy motives or opin-\nions to one whom I was in the habit of respect-\ning\nI do not look on the Colonization Society as\nthe only means, or even the principal means of\nemancipation. For this purpose, I know it can\ndo but little. I would not compel any man to go\nto Liberia. Nor would I advise northern men to\ngo there ; but I would open the door for the be-\nnevolent slaveholders in the South, (and such I\nknow there are,) to manumit their slaves in the\nonly manner which is left them by the laws of\nthe southern states. I would civilize and evan-\ngelize Africa, and thereby stop the slave trade. I\nwould encourage the cultivation of tropical pro-\nducts by free hands in Africa, and thereby dis-\ncourage slave labor. But the object of this letter\nwas to vindicate myself and not the Colonization\nSociety.\nI have taken your paper from its commence-\nment, and, though I do not agree with you in all\nthings, I think you are doing good, and am wil-\nling to give you the poor support of my influence,\nso far as we agree. I have been made wiser, and,\nI believe, better by your paper. You have shewn\nme a pattern of perseverance, zeal and self-deni-\nal, which I have applied to a kindred cause. I\nwish to continue your paper, though you should\ncontinue to reproach me. I trust that my mind\nis open to conviction, and when I am convinced,\nI will change my opinions and my conduct, and\nnot before.\nI have made this letter longer than I intended,\nyet it is not unreasonable for me to request you\nto insert it entire, as it is my vindication.\nYours sincerely,\nWILLIAM LADD.\nMINOT, March 10, 1832.",

The letter was addressed to Mr\nOrr, who, in his challenge, gave the choice of the\nprincipal papers in New-York to his antagonist.\nAt the time I penned the articie which Mr Orr\nhas been pleased to term a 'gasconade,' (al-\nthough his reply savors as much of boastfulness,)\nI was wholly unconscious of there having been\nany reply to my letter. It seems, however, that\nthe officious Ghost of Ashmun has undertaken to\nreply to an article addressed to Mr Orr ; and now\nhe complains of ill usage, because the Editors of\nthe Sentinel did not publish his article as a com-\nmunication, while they inserted mine as an ad-\nvertisement!! The Editors of the New York\nDaily Sentinel are not responsible for article-\nit was therefore disingenuous in Mr Orr to impli-\ncate them.\nThe Shade of Ashmun thinks he has no fear of\nany body with such a mind as mine. Since he\nseems unfortunately to have lost his body, it\nwould be extremely unfair to attack the small re-\nmaining part of him. Therefore we will let him\ngo with the following hint: A ghost need not\nfear any thing corporeal, because, like the tor-\ntoise, it has refuge within its shell whenever dan-\nger approaches. In case of defeat, it would be\nvastly convenient to be unknown, and involve no\nresponsibility!

What must be the constituents of\nsuch a representative?\nMr. Speaker, I am almost afraid to trust myseli\non this subject ; but representing a free people, i\nought to speak as I know they would speak, were\nthey personally present, and I know they would fling\ndefiance in your very teeth on this subject. To have\nthis memorial brought into Congress directly after\nsuch an indignity offered to Georgia by the decision\nof the Supreme Court, which bas gone to that State\non the wings of the wind, looks like an attempt to\ndragoon it into obedience. I can assure this House,\nthey greatly mistake the people of Georgia, if they\nthink they can either drive or frighten them from\nthe stand they have taken. No, Sir, that decree,\nthe subject of so much delight to political aspirants,\nwill never be executed in Georgia ; and whenever\nyou get the Missionaries out of the four walls of the\npenitentiary, depend upon it Georgia will be noth-\ning but a HOWLING WILDERNESS.'\nI ask if Georgia has not as much right to memo-\nrialize Congress, in reference to the manner in which\nNew York treats her Indians, as that the latter\nshould busy herself with Indian aflairs in Georgia ?\nIs she not separating her Indians from the homes\nof their childhood, and bones of their fathers, and,\nwhat is worse, sending them to Green Bay, to freeze,\ntaking froin them a fine fertile soil, and banishing\nthem to a region of almost perpetual snows? But\nI am wrong ; I do the State of New York great in-\njustice--it is not the State of New York who is offi-\nciously obtruding herself upon this House ; it is none\n2\nother than a set of fanatics, gentlemen of the black\ngown, who have, or think they have, all the benev-\nolence and piety that is in this country ; and there-\nfore all the States must be placed under their holy\nkeeping. Georgia will let these pragmatical genule.\nmen, and their backers, know, that whether for con-\nscience sake, or political intrigue sake, they shall\nhave nothing to do with ber attairs.\nYou cannot fight the States mto your views ; kind\ntreatment is the power to keep the Union together,\nand withhold this, and you have no right to expect\nallegiance. I war gentlemen what they do. The\nSouthern States have long been ground under op-\npression, and have only been restrained from an ime\nmediate resort to self-redress from a love of Union,\nand a hope that a sense of justice, at this session of\nCongress, would relieve them from these burdens.\nMr. Speaker, a very high degree of inflammation\nexists, at this very time, throughout all the South.'\n\u2022 Believe me, with the present high degree of ex-\ncitement, on account of other wrongs so often treat-\ned with indifference-- with a state of feeling wound\nup to the highest possible point of endurance, this\nmeasure, preceded by the decision of the Supreme\nCourt, is calculated to apply the match which is to\nrend the Union into a thousand fragments. I will\nnot implore gentlemen to pause, for we have begged\nlong enough ; but I warn them of the danger, if\nthey have any regard for the Union--if they have\nany affection for a sister State-if they have any\ndiscretion left, amidst their thirst for power---balt,\nbefore they proceed another step ; for I repeat, be-\nfore Georgia will surrender her sovereign rights, and\ngive up the government of nearly one-third of her\nterritory, she will not stay one hour in a confederacy\nso lost to every principle of justice.' p We believe that our sheet will be perus-\ned, to-day, with uuusual interest by our readers.\nThe speech of John Ridge, the Cherokee Chief,\nis a document full of novelty and power. The\nstrictures of The Protestant' are applied with\nthat faithfulness and aptitude which distinguish\nthe writings of the author. The Letter of the Rev.\nMr Jocelyn is a fine specimen of christian elo-\nquence and exalted philanthropy. The Address\nto the Members of the Virginia Legislature merits\nnot only their serious attention but that of the\nwhole country. Mr Ladd's communication is\nimportant, and manifests an excellent spirit. Mr\nJones displays good sense, wit and earnestness.",

                    "ocr_text": "It was\nonce\nFrom the Daily Advocate.\nSpeech of John Ridge,\nA CHEROKEE CHIEF,\nAt a meeting in the Old South Church, March 7\nMr. RIDGE, the senior delegate from the Che\nrokee nation, rose to address the audience, and\nwas greeted with great applause. His perso\nis good, his manner free and graceful, and his\naccent peculiar, such as marks the Indian fron\nthe white man. His language was strongl:\nfigurative, though not strictly grammatical, bu\nthe more impressive, perhaps, on that very ac\ncount, from its conformity to the Indian inode o\nexpression : his voice distinct, and his action\nand elocution such as would grace an orator o\nthe schools. We shall not do him justice in the\nsketch we will attempt of his remarks, but i\nwill give some idea of his address for those who\nfeel curious to know how a civilized and wel\nbred Indian talks.\nHe congratulated himself upon being allow\ned, for a second time, to address the sons and\ndaughters of Massachusetts. He would avai\nhimself of the opportunity to state the origin o\nthe mission upon which he had coine to the\ncities of the North. The Cherokee nation, op\npressed by Georgia, betrayed and abandoned to\ntheir enemies by their Father, the President o\nthe United States, had met in council, thoug!\nthe laws of Georgia subjected them to fou\nyears' imprisonment in the penitentiary fo\nholding their own Council in their own ter\nritory over which Georgia had no control.-\nThey recurred to the times when the protect-\ning shield of the United States was extended\nover them, and they reposed in peace, under the\nbroad wings of the American eagle. The tears\nstood in the eyes of their women. They found\ntheir sources of revenue cut off. The annuit\nof about $6,000, which had always been con\nsidered the property of the nation, and paid to\nits chiefs, and with which they had met the ex\npenses of their government, had been order\ned by the President to be paid to the individ\nuals of the nation. Most of it, as was stated\non the former evening, still remained in the\nhands of the United States Agent. But the na\ntion was left destitute. The Council of the\nnation turned their eyes to the North. They se\nlected from among their head men, some o\nthose who could communicate in the English\nlanguage, and they said to us, Go to the cities\nof the North, and let them know of our dis-\ntress. Go to the land of that great man who\nhas buckled on the armor of truth and elo-\nquence, and nobly defended the Cherokees\non the floor of Congress; go to the land of Ed\nWARD EVERETT-[applause]. - Go to the city o\nthat man who struggled for our rights to the\nlast, and died in the cause of the Cherokees\nthe city of Jeremiah Evarts-[some applause.\nTime, he said, would fail him, to do justice to\nthe good and great men who had contended for\nthe rights of the Cherokees. He would most\ngladly detail them all, if time would allow.\nHe referred briefly to the title by which the\nCherokees held their lands. It was a title not\nwritten, but extending beyond memory.\na charter derived from the Great Master of\nbreath, the King of Kings, and to which the pre-\ntensions set up by Georgia, were but as yes-\nterday. The Cherokees, he said, were\na nation of savages; of warriors and hunters.\nHe could himself remember that period. They\nlived in towns of wigwams, with a common\nfence around the dancing ground and council\nfire. There was no individuality of property.\nThe warriors joined in the war dance, and went\nto the chase or the battle, and when they re-\nturned from the latter, the war-whoop gave no-\ntice of their approach, and the number of scalps\nthey brought from the enemy. The scalps\nwere held between a man and woman, who\ndanced in triumph ; and so rode were their wo-\nmen then, that they would put these scalps into\ntheir mouths, and exult and mock over the\nmiseries of the relatives of the slain !\nAt this time, General Washington, the Presi-\ndent of the United States, proposed himself to\nbecome the father of the Indians. He encour-\naged them to lay aside war and the chase,\nand cultivate the arts of civilized life. They\nfollowed the advice of that great man, and they\nhad become a civilized and a christianized com-\nmunity. Instead of joining in the war dance,\ntheir women were now employed in useful in-\ndustry, at the wheel or at the needle, instruct-\ning their children, or attending to their domes-\ntic duties. Instead of going out against their\noppressors with the war song and the tomahawk,\nto wreak vengeance on their enemies, and die\nfighting in the last ditch, their men were now\nbattling with the weapons of intellectual argu-\nment! This fact alone, he should think, ought\nto satisfy any one, that they had become a civ-\nilized nation. He felt a pride in tracing the\nimprovements of his people. They were proud\nto be Cherokees, and would scorn to be compar-\ned to the character of Georgia !--[great ap-\nplause.]\nThe Cherokees, he said, were the only mod-\nern nation, who could clain the honor of hay-\ning invented an Alphabet. George Guess, a\nCherokee Indian, who did not understand a sin-\ngle letter, within a few years had invented an\nalphabet in which a newspaper was now pub-\nlished in the Cherokee nation, and their child\nziren taught to read and write. He was a poor\nman, living in a retired part of the nation, and\nhe told the head men one day, that he could\nmake a book. The chiefs replied it was im-\npossible, because, they said, the Great Spirit\nat first made a red boy and a white boy: to the\nEed boy he gave a book, and to the white boy a\nhow and arrow, but the white boy came round\nEhe red boy, stole his book and went off, leav-\neng him the bow and arrow, and therefore an\nEndian could not make a book. But George\nGuess thought he could. He shut himself up\nEo study ; his com was leit to the weeds, and\nhe was pronounced a crazy man, by the tribe.\nHis wife thought so too, and burnt up his\nmanuscripts, whenever she could find them ; but\ne persevered. He first attempted to form a\ncharacter for every word in the Cherokee lan-\nguage, but was forced to abandon it. He then\nset about discovering the number of sounds\nn the language, which he found was 86, and\nEor each of these be adopted a character, which\nForms the alphabet, and these characters com-\nbined, like letters, form words. Having ac-\ncomplished this, he called together six of bis\nneighbors, and said, now I can make a book.\nThey did not believe him. To convince them,\ne asked them each to make a speech, which he\nvrote down as they spoke, and then read to\nhem, so that each one knew his own speech,\n-nd they then acknowledged he could make\nbook, and from this invention of this great\nman, the Cherokees have become a reading peo-\nle.\nHe referred to the treaties formed between\nThe United States and the Cherokees, and par-\nEcularly to the opinions of Jefferson on that\nubject. His honored father was one of the\nead men who went to Washington, and at that\nEme the government of the Cherokees was\nmarked out by Jefferson himself. He read from the Cherokee Ph\u00e6nix, a letter of Jefferson to\nthem, recoinmending them to establish a coun-\ncil after the manner of U. S. Congress, and\nto adopt a code of laws,-referring them to\nMr. Meigs, the U.S. Agent, for all the infor-\nmation they might want relative to the laws of\nthe United States, to assist them in framing\ntheir own laws. The speaker said that when\nhis father returned from that mission to Wash-\nington, he was a boy, and he told him that he\nhad made a lasting peace with the U. States, and\nthat he must respect and love them. He told\nhim that he must go and learn to read the book\nof the white man, that when the white people\ncame to visit his father, he might interpret to\nthem, and grow up to be an honor to his nation\nand a great man. He was eight years old when\nhe went to the school of the missionaries, and\nit seemed to his little heart, that there were\nobstacles higher than the mountains between\nhim and the knowledge of the white man. But\nhe persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, and\nhe hoped he had succeeded so far as to be able to\ninterpret for his father and for his people, and to\nfulfil the desires for which he intended him.-\n[Much applause.]\nHe was unwilling to disturb the great satis-\nfaction which he saw prevailing over this gener-\nous audience at the good news they had just\nheard from Washington, that the Supreme Court\nhad declared that the Cherokees were right and\nGeorgia wrong, but he felt bound to mention\nsome of the policy that Georgia had pursued\ntoward the Cherokees. When the nation was\nsavage and barbarous, and their tomahawks\nstruck at the heads of Georgia, there were no\npretensions set up that they were intruders upon\nher soil. But when they laid aside the weapons\nof the chase and the war club, and took up the\narts of peace, then Georgia discovered this great\nbugbear of an imperium in imperio, a govern-\nment within a government, and began her meas-\nures to drive them from their lands. She said the\nmissionaries are putting lights into the heads of\nthese Indians, and they may become too wise for\nus. We must drive them beyond the big river\nof the West, and take their lands to make a Lot-\ntery for Georgians to draw for. They went to\nthat goud man, James Monroe, and he told them\nhe could not drive the Indians from their pos-\nsessions. They were under the protection of the\nfaith of the U. States. President Adams also pro-\ntected them, and drove the Georgia intruders\nfrom their soil. The chain of their treaties with\nthe U. States was kept bright and unbroken. But\nwhen the Indians, harassed by Georgia, went\nto President Jackson for protection, he told them\nthat he could not protect them ; that Georgia was\nstrong, and they must submit to her laws, or go\nbeyond the big River of the West. For a long\ntime they could not believe this, but they had\nbeen left to the mercies of Georgia, and been\nmade to feel that it was true. They could not\nbelieve that if the President could not protect\nthem when they were so near him, he could\nprotect them when they should go a great way off\ninto the western wilds.\nThe Supreme Court had now decided the Mis-\nsionary case in favor of the rights of the Chero-\nkees, but the Executive of the United States de-\nclares that Georgia is in the right. It remains to\nbe seen if the decision of the Court can be sus-\ntained. If it is, the clouds of despondency, that\nhad so long hung over his people, would be dis-\npersed like the fogs before the rising sun.\nThe Cherokees, he said, stood upon their rights,\nand upon the faith of a long chain of treaties with\nthe United States. They were not desirous of\nsetting up a government independent of the U.\nStates, if the U. States would admit them, as\ncitizens, to participate in the benefits of their\ngovernment. They were anxious to carry into\neffect the benevolent designs of Washington. They\nwere willing to become a State of the Union.\nHe knew that many would look upon this as\npresumption, but was it asking too much, either\nto be left to enjoy their own government, as an\nindependent people, or to be admitted to the\nrights of other States in the Union. He referred to\nthe recommendations of Washington in 1792,\nwhich had some allusion to such an event.\nHe said that the United States and Georgia had\nbeen constantly trying to get them to dispose of\ntheir lands, the United States by purchase, and\nGeorgia by force. They told the United States\nthat they had sold all the land they could spare.\nThey had left only enough for themselves and\ntheir descendants to stand upon, without being\nswallowed up by Georgia, and they would seil\nno more. [Applause.) A new plan was then\nstarted by Georgia. The laws of that State were\nexterded over them, and they were told hy the\nPresident they must either submit to the laws, or\ngo into the far West, and turn their backs upon\nhe white man, and upon the graves of their fath-\ners, forever. They could not believe that this was\nto be the end of all their treaties with the United\nStates ; they would not believe it, till they had\nEested the faith of the government in every and all\nthe branches of its constituted authorities.\nBut the chains fastened upon the Cherokees\nwere yet strong and galling. Their hearts were\nyet bleeding under the yoke that has been plac-\ned upon their necks, by Georgia, and held there\nBy the President of the United States. True\nthere was now a gleam of light in the surround-\nEng darkness\u2014the decision in the Missionary case\nwas favorable to the Cherokees, but it is a decis-\nEon that will be of no effect, unless the people in\nthis state and in the U. S. shall rise up in the\nmajesty of their might and see the laws carried\ninto effect. The fate of the Cherokees, he beg-\nged leave to say, in view of the untarnished name\nof these United States, the fate of the Cherokees\nwas but a small consideration compared with the\nhonor and faith of this whole nation, which was\nEnvolved in their destruction. Though they re-\noiced at the prospect that the light was break-\nng, yet but a small gleam of sunshine was cast\napon them. They were still oppressed by Geor-\ngia. In the language of the venerable Choc-\nCaw Chief when he was compelled to sign a\nEreaty to sell his lands, we are distressed, we are\nBistressed ! Great expenses had been incurred in\ncontesting their rights with Georgia, and great\nexpenses would be required to complete the\nwork now begun. But he rejoiced that the inter-\nests of the Cherokees were now connected with\nChe interest and honor of this whole people, to\nmaintain their laws, and sustain the decision of\nCheir Supreme Tribunal.\nOn this spot, where he had the honor of speak-\nng, the first resistance was made against the de-\nEigns of Great Britain to enslave this people, and\nhe was happy to be here, to speak in behalf of bis\npeople in a city, from which he hoped an im-\npetus would start and go forth to bring up the\nvhole people to the aid of the Cherokees, and to\nhe support of the decision of the Supreme Court !\nreiterated applause.] 'The battle which had long\nbeen raging, was now set in array between Geor-\ngia and the laws, between Georgia and the Con-\ntitution. The Cherokee nation had long stood\nm the front rank of this battle, though a feeble\npeople. They had nearly been crushed. They\nnight yet be trodden under foot and perish, before",

I con-\nsulted a few friends on the subject of having\na public meeting there ; none seemed willing\nto take any share in the responsibility of such\na movement; yet, none manifested any ob-\njection to my making an appointment. I finally\ndetermined to apply for the City Hall, which\nwas generously granted me by the Council\nBoard, without a dissenting voice. The meet-\ning was publicly notified to be held on the\nevening of the 10th. In the afternoon of that\nday, I was informed that public sentiment was\nvery strong against me, and I was led to ex-\npeet there might be some opposition. At the\nappointed hour, I went to the Hall, under feel-\nings of peculiar solemnity, to plead the cause\nof the oppressed before a congregation where\nslavery is a prominent feature in their civil\npolity. The evening was wet and boisterous;\nnevertheless, I had a respectable audience.\nI knew not the sentiments or feelings of a\nsingle one of them; but having come there\nnot in my own name, but in the name of suf-\nfering humanity, relying not upon myself, nor\nupon an arm of flesh, for protection, but upon\nthat Almighty arm of love and power, which\nwas so signally extended for the deliverance\nof Israel from Egyptian bondage, I was\nstrengthened to stand fearlessly as the advo-\ncate of the poor, despised descendants of\nAfrica. I have in no instance before, used\nlanguage equally severe against the oppres-\nsors, as I used on this occasion. I mention\nthis, because I think it my duty to record the\nliberality of the audience, who not only heard\nme patiently through, with the most respect-\nful attention, but gave me at the close an ex-\npression of approbation, and concurrent feel-\ning, and concluded with a contribution to our\nschool fund of $21,06.\nThe next day I called on several friends,\nand was cheered to find that there were a\nnumber in that place, prepared to co-operate\nin any measures, sanctioned by law, humanity\nand religion,' to effect the abolition of slavery.\nIn the afternoon, I returned to Philadelphia\nin the boat; on board of which was a wealthy\ncitizen of Wilmington,* who, not knowing me,\ninformed me that a person had been lecturing\nin Wilmingion on slavery, and that he had\nendeavored, but in vain, to get others to join\nhim, to go and take the lecturer out of the\nHall. When I informed him that I was the\nperson, he took a look, and seemed quite in-\ndisposed for any further conversation on the\nsubject.\nOn arriving in this city, I had the pleasure\nof taking tea, and spending the evening at the\nhouse of our friend Joseph Cassey, in company\nwith James Forten and Robert Purvis and\ntheir families, Capt. Sargent from London,\nEvan Lewis and Dr. Atlee, of this city, and\nProfessor Wright and lady, who are on their\nway to take up their residence in New-York.\nI trust the day is not far distant, when such\nsocial parties will be far more frequent than\nhas heretofore been the case.\nYet, my friends, I mourn over the hardness\nand obduracy of the human heart, which so\ngenerally in this highly favored land rejects a\nbrother who is 'guilty of a skin not colored\nlike our own.' Ah! when shall the glorious\nday dawn, in which the principles of the gos-\npel of Jesus Christ shall be submitted to, by\nthose who are called by his name? When\nthe professors of the Christian religion shall\nlearn to regard every man as a brother, and\nnot to despise him because the Supreme Ruler\nof the Universe has seen fit in his inscrutable\nwisdom, to give to one a different complexion\nfrom another? When shall this unholy pre-\njudice, which must, of necessity, forever ex-\nclude the soul which harbors it from the king-\ndom of God, be done away. Will its removal\never be accomplished by that persevering cru-\nsade against the people of color, which is now\nstriving to banish them from this good land,\nthis land of literature and of arts, this land of\nbibles and churches, to the burning shores of\nLiberia. No-persecution, though professed-\nly for their good, is not the way to exterminate\nfrom our own bosoms those fiend-like preju-\ndices. Let the nation, then, as it values its\nown prosperity, abandon the Colonization cru-\nsade, and set about improving the condition\nof the colored population of our country, and\nspending the money, which is now thrown\naway on that foolish enterprise, in educating\nthat deeply injured portion of our population.\nWe should soon find them adding strength and\nstability to our institutions, and contributing\ntheir full share to the respectability and pros-\nperity of the nation.\nAdieu,\nARNOLD BUFFUM.\nHe lived 5 miles from Wilmington, a Frenchman, [For the Liberator.]\nPROTEST AGAINST THE AMERICAN\nCOLONIZATION SOCIETY.\nMe. Editor : The Protest, signed by\nWILBERFORCE, and the other principal Abo-\nlitionists in England, has excited the wrath of\nall classes of the oppressors and their compro-\nmising friends. Nothing is more ludicrous,\nwere it not so distressing, as to witness the\nsophistry and cunning craftiness with which\nsome men attempt to destroy the influence of\ntruth, while they at the same time profess to\nlove and defend it. Of this, the New-York\nObserver, of Oct. 5, furnishes a melancholy\nspecimen. The Protest of those renowned\nphilanthropists is published with their com-\nments, the character of which is exactly simi-\nlar to the double-dealing implied in a ques-\ntion in the Observer of September 21. It is\nasked What shall a Christian do with slaves\nin his possession, in States where the laws do\nno not permit emancipation?' This inquiry\nis just as wise, as if a man were to ask-\n\"What shall a receiver of stolen goods do\nwith articles in his possession, which he can\nretain and use without discovery?'\nIt is recorded of Charles II. that at a meet-\ning of the Royal Society of London, he once\nproposed this question- Why does a fish\nweigh more out of the water than in the wa-\nter?' One adduced lis philosophical explan-\nation, and another a different hypothesis; and\nafter a variety of reasons,with which the merry\nmonarch was greatly delighted; at last, he ap-\npealed to a famous ichthyologist for his views.\n\"I deny the fact;' was the reply. Upon which\nthe king stated, that he had only proposed the\ninquiry to amuse himself at the expense of\ntheir pretended learning.\nIn proposing the above question, the editors\nof the Observer, also, must have intended to\namuse themselves at the expense of the slave-\nholders. 'I deny the fact,'\u2014that a man-steal-\ner, or a receiver and holder of kidnapped men,\nwomen and children, can prove his title to be a\nChristian at all. However, this evasion of\ntruth, and this strange solecism, is a complete\nexample of the manner in which they have\nattempted to conceal the truth, censure the\nProtesters, and gratify their man-stealing sub-\nscribers.\nThe N. Y. Observer, in its criticisms upon\nthe Protest, not only keeps clear of the main\ntopic, but also confounds so many other sub-\njects with it, that common readers in vain will\nread its notions. What connection is there\nbetween Sunday Schools and Bible Societies,\nand the enormous sin of man-stealing ? The\nwriter in the Observer so discusses the point,\nthat no person would suppose that there was\nany other inquiry connected with it, than a\nsimple question of national policy. \"They\ntithe the mint, and annise and cummin, and\nomit judgment, mercy and faith. It is unne-\ncessary to review their whole discussion,\nbut we must notice the prominent parts.\nThey say that many Christian slaveholders\nearnestly desire to emancipate their slaves.\nMark you! Christian man-stealers! What\nan imposing title! what glaring deception !\nwhat wrapping up of the most atrocious guilt!\nThe statement is not true, or those man-steal-\ners would instantly quit stealing. No man\nis obliged to be a thief; no man is forced to\nreceive and keep stolen goods; his guilt is\nvoluntary, and all his professions of willing-\nness to abandon slavery are mere hypocrisy,\nuntil he abandons his crime and does justice\nto the victims of his oppression. But it is by\nthus covering sin, that the slave-dealers are\npropitiated, and their subscriptions obtained.\nThe N. Y. Observer also declares that 'hun-\ndreds and thousands of slaves wish to be\nemancipated, and to be removed to Liberia.'\nThis is not directly false, but it indirectly con-\nveys an untruth, or rather it is a lie by defect.\nSlaves wish to be emancipated ;' that is the\nfact-yet they do not wish to be removed to\nLiberia; except as they are assured, that they\nhave no alternative, but either to be tortured\nand treated like beasts in America, or to risk\nstarvation and premature death in Liberia-\nand of the two, some prefer the latter. It is\na scandal to the press, that such gross imposi-\ntions should be disseminated throughout the\nworld by means of the N. Y. Observer.\nThe N. Y. Observer denies that 'the colony\nwas formed chiefly to indulge the prejudices\nof American slaveholders.' They may deny,\nbut the fact is true; and every man who\nknows any thing of the South, knows that it\nwas never intended as a scheme to facilitate\nthe emancipation of slaves, but to transport\nthe free people, and thereby to increase and\nprolong the fetters of man-stealing bondage.\nThe N. Y. Observer also denies that the\nColonization scheme 'exposes the colored\npeople to great practical persecution, in order\nto force them to emigrate.' A man who de-\nnies the existence of this system in its contin-\nual operation at the South, may just as truly\naffirm, that there is no difference between the\nchills of January and the heat of July. What\ninduced the rioters at New-Haven forcibly to\nobstruct a school for the instruction of colored\nyouth? What stimulated the ruffians at Can-\nterbury to commit every beastly outrage upon\nMiss Crandall? What brought together the\nNew-York mob of infidels and profligates to\nabuse the members of the New-York Anti-\nSlavery Society? Nothing else than a reso-\nlution, if possible, to demonstrate to the color-\ned people that, in this country, they shall en-\njoy neither the rights of man, the blessings of 6\na\neducation, the privileges of citizens, nor the\npeace of Christians\u2014and all this is not forcing\nthem too emigrate. They must be hewers of\nwood and drawers of water; they are denied\nall instruction, trafficked like cattle, slaves of\nthe vilest personal outrages both male and\nfemale, starved, worked, lacerated, and doom-\ned to hopeless servitude; and some few scores\nof the two millions are offered a transportation\nto Africa, where the cart-whip shall not\nscourge them, and their female companions\nand daughters shall not be violated before\ntheir eyes. Of two evils, as they cannot re-\nfuse one of them, they choose as they think\nthe least, and expatriate themselves to Libe-\nria to die in the seasoning. And yet, says\nthe N. Y. Observer, we have no evidence\nthat the colored people have as yet endured\nany such great practical persecution. There\nis an old saying, and the Observer thus proves\nits title to be inculpated in all its folly and\ncensure- None are so blind as those who\nwill not see.\nTo us, the manner of proceeding by all the\nparties who espouse the Colonization cause,\nis most painful. It shews that the moral sense\nand the conscientious perception of gospel\nequity are perfectly blunted. For a long time\npast, I have deprecated the course of the\ncontroversy upon slavery. It has been the\ncunning artifice of the Southern kidnappers,\nand their Northern doughfaced coadjutors, to\nintroduce a number of paltry topics into the\nfield of debate, by which the grand master-\npiece of iniquity has been concealed. The\nfriends of immediate emancipation thereby\nhave been drawn off from their momentous\nobject; they have been endeavoring to dry\nup the petty streams, while the overflowing\nfountain remains undrained; and they have\nbeen lopping off a few unsightly or withered\nbranches, while their crafty opponents have\nbeen nursing and strengthening and propping\nup the tree which sends forth all the compli-\ncated evil fruits of unrighteousness.\nIt is high time to retrace our steps, and\n\"begin at the beginning,\u2019and lay the axe to the\nroot of the tree. All the noise which we hear\nabout colonization is a mere deception,-'all\nthe professions of slaveholders and their north-\nern associates, of promoting the abolition of\nslavery,' are altogether delusive! They know\nit, and we know it. That the Colonization\nSociety was intended to be an obstruction to\nthe destruction of slavery,' they are convinced ;\nand we can prove that it has produced its de-\nsigned effects. That it is rooted in a cruel\nprejudice and alienation against the colored\npeople,' all persons are assure and even the\nNew-York Observer has not the effrontery to\ndeny this scandalous reproach upon freemen\nand Christians.\nHence, it follows, that we must recur to the\nfundamental principles of Christian morals.\nAll slaveholders, as they are oracularly defin-\ned by the Presbyterian confession of faith, are\nStealers of men, guilty of the highest kind of\ntheft, and sinners of the first rank. That must\nbe our text, with the Methodist commentary ;\nthey are impenitent transgressors, who never\nhad a sincere desire to flee from the wrath to\ncome. Consequently they must be instructed,\nwarned, admonished, menaced, and encourag-\ned to 'cease to do evil, and to learn to do well,\nlike all other violators of the law of God.\nThe matchless enormity of their sin, for slave-\nholding includes the simultaneous transgres-\nsion of the whole decalogue; the claims of\nGod, the authority of the gospel, the de-\nmands of reciprocal equity, and the horrors\nof divine exact retribution, must be re-\nsounded in all their distinctness and energy,\nuntil the sinners in Zion are afraid,\nand fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites!\nWe must cry aloud and spare not, lift up our\nvoices like trumpets, and show' Christian slave-\nholders! their trangressions, and their com-\npromising friends, the Observer's, the Record-\ner's, the Chronicle's, the Danforth's, the Fin-\nley's, and the Spectator's, with all the other\nworthy dough-faced tribes who are confedera-\nted with the land pirates; we must show them\ntheir sin's,' their deceitfulness, their impos-\ntures, and their danger; who, as the Prophet\nsays,-Amos vi: 1-6\u2014are at ease in Zion;\nwho put far away the evil day, and cause the\nseat of violence to come near; but they are\nnot grieved for the affliction of Joseph' Wo\nunto them that call evil good, and good evil;\nthat put darkness for light, and light for dark-\nness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for\nbitter!!-Isaiah y: 20.\nI long to see some one of our Anti-Slavery\nbrethren, who understands the subject, come\nout upon this topic in all its evangelical faith-\nfulness and power, and illustrate the questions\nconnected with slavery, not by the rules of\nworldly expediency, but by the standard of\ninfallible truth. This will have indiscribably\nmore effect than all the disputations respect-\ning trifles which are not of a feather's weight,\nin determining or hastening the death of that\nfiend-like monster, American Slavery.\nEXAMINER.\nWhere is the Incendiary Fanatic with\nhis Christian Firebrands? He might reply to\nthe call of Examiner. If he will send us his\nscorchers, we will scatter them.-Ed. Lib.\n6",

EDITOR,\u2014\nOn reading some time since the authorised\npublications of the Colonization Society, I was\nforcibly reminded of a remark made by Cot-\nton Mather, in that wonderful book, the Mag-\nnalia. Speaking of a certain place in New-\nEngland, he says, \u201cIt is a refuge for all sorts\nof consciences, so that if any man should lose\nhis religion, he would know where to go and\nfind it.' The same remark is in substance\njustly applicable to the African Repository,\nfor in that publication may be found all sorts\nof sentiments and opinions concerning slavery,\nin every variety of expression, and calculated\nto suit all sorts of consciences. In the lan-\nguage of the poet, he will indeed find,\n\"A wilderness of strange con\u201c son,\nTeeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,\nNectareous essences, Olympian sweets,\nEthereal journeys, transmarine exploits,\nAnd\u2019 Mr. Danforth with his hair on end,\nWith his own wonders, wondering for his bread.'\nDoes any person wish to read an exalted\ndescription of the intellect and disposition of\nthe blacks, their capacity for improvement,\ntheir docility and the native kindness of their\ntempers ? Let him peruse the pages of the\nAfrican Repository, and he will find abundant\nevidence that the capacity of the blacks for\nmoral and intellectual improvement, is not in-\nferior to that of their white brethren. This\nfact that publication admits, coupled however,\nwith this restriction, they must either be in-\nhabitants of Liberia, or engaged to go thither.\nUnlike all other objects, which lessen as they\nrecede from view, the blacks, who, while in\nthis country, are too mean and contemptible,\nto be noticed only to be despised by a certain\nclass, suddenly become marvellous proper\nmen\u2019the moment they determine to leave the\ncountry, and when fairly landed in Liberia,\nare paragons of moral and intellectual great-\nness, and attract the attention, the envy and\nthe admiration of the world.\nDoes any one wish to see the free blacks\nslandered, and vilified, and degraded below\nthe beasts that perish, by every combination\nof epithets that an unholy prejudice and malic-\nious fancy can invent? Let him read the pages\nof the African Repository and he will there\nfind it passim, ad libitum, every where, to his\nhearts content.\nDoes any one in short, wish to see how\nwidely different the ostensible designs of the\nSociety are from its real, practical and intended\neffects, where morality is determined by lati-\ntude, where the immutable laws of Jehovah's\nkingdom are superseded by the mutable doc-\ntrine of expediency, and where contradictions\nare almost as thickly sprinkled as right angles\nin a checker board, let him examine carefully\nthe official records of the Colonization Society\nwith the essays and letters of their Agents.\nLet us for instance, examine Mr. Danforth's\nletter of the 15th September last, a little far-\nther.

He had\noften, and previous to his journey, conversed on the\nall important and fast becoming popular subject of sla-\nvery, and had as often expressed his views on the sub-\nject, that though slavery was in the abstract a great\nevil, yet as it existed, the slaves could be in no better\ncondition than that of bondage. He contended that\nhe believed them perfectly happy, and was almost\nready to advance the doctrine so freely bruited, that\nblacks are but a step removed from the brute crea-\ntion. During his journey he had an opportunity of\nwitnessing a specimen of their happiness and also con-\nvincing proof that blacks were flesh and blood, and at\nleast possessed the feeling of human beings. But here\nthe narrative as near as I can recollect in the words\nof his lady, who accompanied him : We were riding\nin a carriage driven by a white man, when we were\nmet by a team on which the driver, a colored man,\nsat nodding his head, as if asleep. As we passed, our\ndriver, taking deliberate aim, eracked his whip in the\nface of the black, which was immediately followod by\na heart-rending shriek and profuse gush of blood, if\nindeed the eye did not come also. My husband, much\nenraged at this brutality, called out to driver to\nknow what he had done so for, and was met by the\nanswer of \" Shut up--we want none of your dom d\nyankee interferenee here, d-you; and if you\ndon't like it you can get out and walk.\u201d My husband\nhere attempted to get out of the coach to beat the dri-\nver as he said, but by holding him and reminding him\nwhere we were, he abandoned it, and we said no\nNot so our driver. He took particular care\neach slave we met, either man, woman or child, to\nturn out of the road sufficient to bring them within\nreach of his whip. When exerting all his strength to\nthe blow, he would join his fiendish laugh to their\nscreams, and turning, ask us how we liked that ?'\nmore.",

                    "ocr_text": "JUDGE DAGGETT'S CHARGE.\nAs a matter of record, and for the amaze\nment of posterity, we insert the following\nCharge of Judge Daggett, on the trial of Mis:\nPrudence Crandall for the awful crime of in\nstructing colored youth:\n\"This is an information filed by the Attor-\nney for the State, for the alledged violation o\na Statute law, passed by the General Assem\nbly, at their last session, relating to inhabitants\nthe preamble to the act, embracing the rea-\nsons for the law. It reads thus:\nWhereas attempts have been made to es-\ntablish literary Institutions in this State, fou\nthe instruction of colored persons belonging\nto other States and countries, which would\ntend to the great increase of the colored pop-\nulation of the State and thereby to the injury\nof the people; Therefore it is enacted that no\nperson shall set up or establish, in this State,\nany school, academy, or literary institution, for\nthe instruction or education of colored persons\nwho are not inhabitants of this State, nor in-\nstruct or teach in any school, academy, or lit-\nerary institution, or harbor or board, for the\npurpose of attending or being taught or in-\nstructed in any such school, any colored per-\nson not an inhabitant of any town in this\nState, without the consent, in writing, first\nobtained of a majority of the civil authority\nand select men of the town where such school\nis situated, on penalty,' &c.\nIt is alledged in this information, that since\nthe 22d day of August last, to wit, on the 24th\nday of September 1833, the defendant has\nwilfully and knowingly, harbored and boarded\ncolored persons not inhabitants of the State\nfor the purpose mentioned in said act, without\nhaving obtained in writing, the consent of the\ncivil authority and select men of the town of\nCanterbury, where the school has been set up.\nAs to the facts in this case, there seems to be\nbut little controversy. It has scarcely been\ndenied, that colored persons have been harbor-\ned and boarded by the defendant for the ob-\njects alledged, within the time set forth in this\ninformation. You, Gentlemen of the Jury,\nhave heard the evidence, and as it is your ex-\nclusive business to pass upon these facts, you\nwill say whether or not they are true.\nIf these facts are not proved to your satis-\nfaction, then you may dismiss the case, for in\nthat event you have no further duty to perform.\nIf, however, you find the facts true, then anoth-\ner duty equally important, devolves upon the\nJury. It is an undeniable proposition, that the\nJury are judges of both law and fact, in all\ncases of this nature. It is, however, equally\ntrue, that the Court is to state its opinion to\nthe Jury, upon all questions of law, arising in\nthe trial of a criminal cause, and to submit to\ntheir consideration, both law and fact, without\nany direction how to find their verdict.\n9. The counsel for the defendant have rested\nher defence upon a provision of the constitu-\ntion of the United States, claiming that the\nstatute law of this State, upon which this in-\nformation is founded, is inconsistent with that\nprovision, and therefore void. This is the\ngreat question involved in this\ncase,\nand it is\nabout to be submitted to your consideration.\nIt is admitted that there are no provisions\nin the constitution of this State which conflict\nwith this act. It may be remarked here that\nthe constitution of the United States is above\nall other law,---it is emphatically the supreme\nlaw of the land, and the Judges are so to de-\nclare it. From the highest court to the low-\nest, even that of a justice of the peace, all\nlaws, whether made by Congress or State\nLegislatures, are subject to examination, and\nwhen brought to the test of the constitution,\nmay be declared utterly void. But in order\nto do this, the court should first find the law\ncontrary, and plainly contrary to the constitu-\ntion. Although this may be done, and done\ntoo by the humblest court, yet it never should\nbe done but upon a full conviction that the\nlaw in question is unconstitutional.\nMany things said upon this trial, may be\nlaid out of the case. The consideration of\nSlavery, with all its evils and degrading con-\nsequences, may be dismissed, with the consid-\neration that it is a degrading evil. The bene-\nfits, blessings and advantages of instruction\nand education, may also cease to claim your | attention, except you may well consider tha\neducation is a fundamental privilege,' for thi\nis the basis of all free governments.\nHaving read this law, the question come\nto us with peculiar force, does it clearly violat\nthe Constitution of the United States ?-Th\nsection claimed to have been violated, read\nas follows, to wit: - Art. 4-Sec. 2.-The citi\nzens of each State, shall be entitled to a\nprivileges and immunities of citizens in th\nseveral States. It has been urged that thi\nsection was made to direct, exclusively, th\naction of the General Government, and there\nfore can never be applied to State laws. Thi\nis not the opinion of the court. The plain an\nobvious meaning of this provision, is, to secur\nto the citizens of all the States, the same privi\nleges as are secured to our own, by our ow\nState laws. Should a citizen of Connecticu\npurchase a farm in Massachusetts, and th\nLegislature of Massachusetts tax the owne\nof that farm, four times as much as they woul\ntax a citizen of Massachusetts, because th\none resided in Connecticut and the other i\nMassachusetts ; or should a law be passed b\neither of those States, that no citizen of the\nother, should reside or trade in that other, thi\nwould undoubtedly be an unconstitutional law\nand should be so declared.\nThe 2d section was provided as a substitut\nfor the 4th article of the Confederation. Tha\narticle has also been read, and by comparing\nthem, you can perceive the object intended by\nthe substitute.\nThe act in question, provides that colore\npersons who are not inhabitants of this State\nshall not be harbored and boarded, for the pur\nposes therein mentioned, within this State\nwithout the consent of the civil authority and\nselectmen of the town. We are then brough\nto the great question, are they citizens within\nthe provisions of this section of the Constitu\ntion? The law extends to all persons o\ncolor not inhabitants of this State, whethe\nthey live in the State of New-York, or in the\nWest Indies, or any other foreign country.\nIn deciding this question, I am very happy\nthat my opinion can be revised by the Supreme\nCourt of this State, and of the United States\nshould you return \u00e5 verdict against the de\nfendant.\nThe persons conteniplated in this act are\nnot citizens within the obvious meaning of that\nsection of the Constitution of the United\nStates, which I have just read. Let me begin\nby putting this plain question. Are slaves\ncitizens ? At the adoption of the Constitution\nof the United States, every State was a slave\nstate. Massachusetts had begun the work of\nemancipation within her own borders. And\nConnecticut, as early as 1784, had also enact-\ned laws making all those free at the age of\n25, who might be born within the state, after\nthat time. We all know that slavery is re-\ncognized in the Constitution, and it is the duty\nof this Court to take that Constitution as it is.\nfor we have sworn to support it. Although the\nterm \"slavery' cannot be found written out in\nthe Constitution, yet no one can mistake the\nobject of the 3d sec. of the 4th article :-\u201cNo\nperson held to service or labor in one state\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another-\nshall in consequence of any law or regulation\ntherein, be discharged from such service on\nlabor, but shall be delivered up on claim of\nthe party to whom such service or labor may\nbe due.\nThe 2d section of the 1st article, reads as\nfollows:- Representatives and direct taxes,\nshall be apportioned among the several states\nwhich may be included in this Union, accord-\ning to their respective numbers, which shall\nbe determined by adding to the whole number\nof free persons, including those bound to ser-\nvice for a term of years, and excluding Indians\nnot taxed, three fifths of all other persons.\"\nThe other persons' are slaves, and they be-\ncame the basis of representation, by adding\nthem to the white population in that propor-\ntion. Then slaves were not considered citi-\nzens by the framers of the Constitution.\nA citizen means a freeman. By referring\nto Dr. Webster, one of the most learned men\nof this or any other country, we have the fol-\nlowing definition of the term\u2014Citizen: 1st,\na native of a city, or an inhabitant who enjoys\nthe freedom and privileges of the city in which\nhe resides. 2, a townsman, a man of trade,\nnot a gentleman. 3. An inhabitant; a dweller\nin any city, town or country. 4. In the United\nStates, it means a person native or naturalized,\nwho has the privilege of exercising the elec-\nLive franchise, and of purchasing and holding\nreal estate.'\nAre Indians citizens? It is admitted in the\nargument that they are not, but it is said they\nDelong to distinct tribes. This cannot be\nCrue, because all Indians do not belong to a\ncribe. It may be now added, that by the de-\nclared law of New York, Indians are not citi-\nzens, and the learned Chancellor Kent says,\nthey never can be made citizens.' Indians\nvere literally natives of our soil,--they were\nporn here, and yet they are not citizens.\nThe Mohegans were once a mighty tribe,\npowerful and valiant; and who among us ever\nsaw one of them performing military duty, or\nexercising, with the white men, the privilege\nof the elective franchise, or holding an office ?\nAnd what is the reason? I answer, they are\nnot citizens, according to the acceptation of\nhe term in the United States.\nAre free blacks, citizens? It has been in-\ncniously said, that vessels may be owned\nnd navigated by free blacks, and the Ameri-\ncan flag will protect them; but you will re-\nmember that the statute which makes that\nprovision, is an act of Congress, and not the\nConstitution. Admit, if you please, that Mr.\nCuffee, a respectable merchant, has owned\nessels, and sailed them under the American\nlag, yet this does not prove him to be such a\ncitizen as the Constitution contemplates. But\nhat question stands undecided by any legal\nribunal within my knowlege. For the pur-\n=oses of this case it may not be necessary to\nEetermine that question.\nIt has been also urged, that as colored per-\nons may commit treason, they must be con-\nidered citizens. Every person born in the\nUnited States, as well as every person who\nmay reside here, owes allegiance of some sort\no the government, because the government\nffords him protection. Treason against this\nFovernment, consists in levying war against\nhe government of the United States, or aid-\nig its enemy in time of war.\n.\n6\nTreason may be committed by persons who are not entitled\nto the elective franchise. For if they reside\nunder the protection of the government, it\nwould be treason to levy war against that gov-\nernment, as much as if they were citizens.\nI think Chancellor Kent, whose authority it\ngives me pleasure to quote, determines this\nquestion by fair implication. Had this author\nconsidered free blacks citizens, he had an am-\nple opportunity to say so. But what he has\nsaid, excludes that idea.\nKent's Commentaries, vol. 2d, p. 258\u2014 In\nmost of the United States, there is a distinc-\ntion in respect to political privileges, between\nfree white persons and free colored persons\nof African blood; and in no part of the coun-\ntry, do the latter, in point of fact, participate\nequally with the whites, in the exercise of\ncivil and political rights. The African race\nare essentially a degraded caste, of inferior\nrank and condition in society. Marriages are\nforbidden between them and whites in some\nof the States, and when not absolutely con-\ntrary to law, they are revolting, and regarded\nas an offence against public decorum. By the\nrevised Statutes of Illinois, published in 1829,\nmarriages between whites and negroes, or\nmulattoes, are declared void, and the persons\nso married are liable to be whipped, fined and\nimprisoned. By an old Statute of Masssachu-\nsetts, of 1705, such marriages were declared\nvoid, and are so still. A similar statute pro-\nvision exists in Virginia and North Carolina.\nSuch connexions in France and Germany,\nconstitute the degraded state of concubinage,\nwhich is known in the civil law. But they\nare not legal marriages, because the parties\nwant that equality of state or condition, which\nis essential to the contract.'\nI go further back still. When the Consti-\ntution of the United States was adopted, every\nState (Massachusetts excepted) tolerated sla-\nvery. And in some of the States, down to a\nlate period, severe laws have been kept in\nforce regarding slaves. With respect to N.\nYork, at that time her laws and penalties\nwere severe indeed, and it was not until July\n4th, 1827, that this great state was ranked\namong the free states.\nTo my mind, it would be a perversion of\nterms, and the well known rule of construc-\ntion, to say that slaves, free blacks, or Indi-\nans, were citizens, within the meaning of that\nterm, as used in the Constitution. God for-\nbid that I should add to the degradation of\nthis race of men, but I am bound by my duty\nto say, they are not citizens.\nI have thus shown you that this law is not\ncontrary to the second section of the fourth\narticle of the Constitution of the U. States,\nfor that embraces only citizens.\nBut there is still another consideration: if\nthey were citizens. I am not sure this law\nwould then be unconstitutional. The Legis-\nlature may regulate schools. I am free to\nsay, that education is a fundamental privilege;\nbut this law does not prohibit schools. It pla-\nces them under the care of the civil authority\nand selectmen, and why is not this a very\nsuitable regulation? I am not sure but the\nLegislature might make a law like this, ex-\ntending the white inhabitants of other\nstates, who are unquestionably citizens, pla-\ncing all schools for them under suitable boards\nof examination, for the public good, and I can\nsee no objection to the board created by this\nWhat can the Legislature of this State do?\nIt can make any law, which any Legislature\ncan make, unless it shall violate the Constitu-\ntion of the United States or the Constitution of\nits own State, and in my opinion this law is\nnot inconsistent with either.\nThe Jury have nothing to do with the popu-\nlarity or unpopularity of this or any other law,\nwhich may come before them for adjudication.\nThey have nothing to do with its policy or\nimpolicy. Your only inquiry is, whether it\nis constitutional.\nI may say with truth, that there is no dispo-\nsition in the judicial tribunals of this State,\nnor among the people, to nullify the laws of\nthe State ; but if constitutional, to submit to\nthem, and carry them into full effect, as good\ncitizens. If individuals do not like the laws\nenacted by one Legislature, their remedy is\nat the ballot boxes. It often occurs, on sub-\njects of taxation, that laws are supposed by\nsome to be unjust and oppressive. Nearly\nevery session of the Assembly, attempts have\nbeen made to alter and change such laws, but\nas long as they exist, they must have effect.\nYou will now take this case into your con-\nsideration, and notwithstanding my opinion of\nthe law, you will return your verdict accord-\ning to law and evidence. I have done my\nduty, and you will do yours.'\nact.",

Yours truly,\nSAMUEL J. MAY.\nBedford, 30th Sept. 1833.\nRev. Sir.--On the late trial of Miss Cran-\ndall, it was thought expedient by her oppo-\nnents to attempt to deprive our whole free\ncolored population, of the protection of the\nConstitution of the United States, by denying\nthat they were citizens. Should a second trial be had, it is possible that the annexed\nauthorities may be of some use and I wil\ntherefore commit them to your care, as I have\nnot the honor of being acquainted with Miss\nCrandall's counsel.\nWith sincere respect for your exertions in\nthe cause of humanity and freedom, I remain\nRev. Sir Your very ob't servant,\nWILLIAM JAY.\nThe Rev. S. J. May.\nExtracts from \u201cReports of the proceedings\nand debates of the Convention of 1821 assem\nbled for the purpose of amending the Consti-\ntution of the State of New-York. By N. S\nCarter & W. L. Stone.\nOn a motion to insert the word 'white' be-\nfore the words 'male citizens' in the article o\nthe Constitution regulating the right of suf\nfrage.\nI would submit to the consideration of the\ncommittee whether the proposition is consist\nent with the constitution of the U. States\nThat instrument provides that 'Citizens o\neach State shall be entitled to all the privi\nleges and immunities of citizens in the seve\nral States. No longer ago than last Novem-\nber, the Legislature of this State almost\nunanimously resolved that \"If the provisions\ncontained in any proposed constitution of a\nnew State, deny to any cittzens of the existing\nStates, the privileges and immunities of citi-\nzens of such new State, that such proposed\nconstitution should not be accepted or con-\nfirmed, the same in the opinion of this Legis-\nlature being void by the Constitution of the\nUnited States.' Now Sir, is not the right of\nsuffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a\ncitizen of Pennsylvania who comes here and\ncomplies with your laws, merely because he\nis not six feet high or because he is of a dark\ncomplexion.'\u2014Speech of Peter A. Jay, p. 184.\nNo longer ago than last winter the Legis-\nlature of this State almost unanimously re-\nsolved that their Senators be instructed and\ntheir Representatives requested to prevent\nany State from being admitted into this Union\nwhich should have incorporated into her con-\nstitution any provision denying to the citizens\nof each State all the rights, privileges and\nimmunities of citizens of the several states.\nThese instructions and requests it is well\nknown, particularly referred to Missouri, and\nwere founded on a clause in her constitution\ninterdicting this very class of people from\ncoming to or settling in that state under any\npretext whatever.'--Speech of R. Clark,p.189.\n\u2018Suppose a negro owning a freehold, and\nentitled to a vote in Vermont, removes to this\nState, can we constitutionally exclude him\nfrom the privileges of voting? The constitu-\ntion of the United States provides that citizens\nof each State shall be entitled to all the privi-\nleges and immunities of citizens of the several\nStates.'--Speech of James Kent, (the Chancel-\nlor,) p. 190.\nThe constitution of the United States is\nbeyond the control of any act of any of the\nStates. It is a compact to which the people\nof this in common with those of other States\nare parties, and cannot recede from it, without\nthe consent of all. With this understanding,\nwhat let me ask, is the meaning of the pro-\nvision quoted by the gentleman from Albany\n(Mr. Kent.) Take the fact that a citizen of\ncolor entitled to all the privileges of a citizen,\ncomes here\u2014he purchases a freehold-can\nyou deny him the rights of an elector incident\nto his freehold? He is entitled to vote be-\ncause like any other citizen he is a frecholder,\nand every freeholder your laws entitled to\nvote. He comes here, he purchases property,\nhe pays your taxes, conforms to your laws-\nhow can you then under the article of the\nconstitution of the U. States which has been\nread exclude him? The gentleman from N.\nYork thinks that the meaning of this provision\nin the U.S. Constitution extends only to civil\nrights. Such is not the text, it is all rights.\nThis seems to me to lay an insuperable bar-\nrier in our way. As certainly as the children\nof any white men are citizens, so certainly the\nchildren of black men are citizens.-Speech of\nRufus King, p. 192.\nIt seems to me that some gentlemen en-\ntertain doubts whether any of our people of\ncolor are in a legal sense citizens; but these\ndoubts are unfounded. We are precluded\nfrom denying their citizenship by our uniform\nrecognition for more than forty years\u2014nay\nsome of them were citizens when this State\ncame into political existence-partook in our\nstruggle for freedom and independence, and\nwere incorporated into the body politic at its\ncreation. There is another and to my mind\nan insuperable objection to the exclusion of\nfree citizens of color from the right of suffrage,\narising from the provision of the Constitution\nof the U.S. that the citizens of each State\nshall be entitled to all the privileges and im-\nmunities of citizens in the several States.?-\nSpeech of Abraham Van Vechten, p. 193.\nLetter from De Witt Clinton, Governor of\nN. York to President Adams.\nALBANY, 4th Sept. 1826.\nSir, I have the honor to enclose copies of\nthe proceedings of a respectable meeting in\nWest Chester County in this State, and of an\nAffidavit of John Owen, by which it appears\nthat one Gilbert Horton a free man of color\nand a citizen of this State is unlawfully impris-\noned in the jail of the city of Washington, and\nis advertised to be sold by the Marshal of the\nDistrict of Columbia. From whatever author-\nity a law authorising such proceedings may\nhave emanated, whether from the municipality\nof Washington, the Legislature of Maryland,\nor the Congress of the United States, it is at\nleast void and unconstitutional in its applica-\ntion to a citizen, and could never have intend-\ned to extend further than to fugitive slaves.\nAs the District of Columbia is under the ex-\nclusive control of the National Govornment I\nconceive it my duty to apply to you for the\nliberation of Gilbert Horton as a freeman, and\na citizen, and feel persuaded that this request\nwill be followed by immediate relief.\nI have the honor to be &c.\nDE WITT CLINTON.\nThe President of the U.S.",

                    "ocr_text": "[From the London Patriot of July 10.]\nAMERICAN COLONIZATION\nSOCIETY\nIn our paper of this day will be found a\nreport of the Second Lecture given by Mr.\nGARRison, the agent to the New-England\nAnti-Slavery Society, and a communication,\ndesigned as a counter-statement, from Mr.\nElliott Cresson, a representative of the\nAmerican Colonization Society; a Society\nwhich stands pledged to the pursuit of one\nobject exclusively-the colonization of free\npersons of color in Africa or some other place.\nWhy should these two objects be deemed\nincompatible\u2014the abolition of slavery and the\ncolonization of Africa by free or emancipated\nblacks? We have in this country an Afri-\ncan Institution and an Anti-Slavery Society.\nThey are not deemed with us to be in opposi-\ntion to each other, but the reverse; and the\nchief promoters of the colony of Sierra Le-\none have been foremost among the advocates\nfor the total emancipation of the West India\nslave population. How comes it to pass, then,\nthat Mr. Garrison and Mr. Cresson are thus\nat open variance?\nThe plain answer to these questions is, that\nthe American Colonization Society does not\nmerely confine itself to its avowed object,\nAfrican colonization, which it would be justi-\nfied in doing, but that, unlike the originators\nand members of the African Institution in this\ncountry, it opposes the emancipation of slaves,\nexcept on the condition of their expulsion from\ntheir native land; and it founds this opposition\nupon delusive pretexts and principles of an\nunjust and anti-Christian character.\nThis is what Mr. Garrison affirms, and chal-\nlenges Mr. Cresson to disprove. The latter\ngentleman has refused to accept the chal-\nlenge, or to meet his countryman before a\nBritish audience. His only answer is, a plea\nin favor of Liberia, as adapted to civilize Afri-\nca, and to put down the slave trade. Is this\nan answer, or a mere evasion ?\nAs friends to Sierra Leone, we must be\nfriends, also, to Liberia. We applaud the en-\nterprise, whatever motives have actuated its\npromoters. We take the liveliest interest in\nAfrican colonization, and cordially wish suc-\ncess to the American Colonization Society, so\nfar as Liberia is concerned. But, excellent as\nis their avowed object, we regard the avowed\nprinciples upon which they pursue that object\nas detestable. Upon this point we should be\nglad to find ourselves in error; but we will not\nsuffer ourselves or the public to be deceived.\nThe avowed principles of the American\nColonization Society, then, as interpreted in\ntheir own documents, are- _That the free peo-\nple of color in the United States are, solely\non account of their color or race, justly and\nnecessarily deprived of citizenship and of the\nprivileges of white freemen: that, although\nborn in America of native parents, and of\nmixed breed, they are to be considered as for-\neigners, and Africa as their native country:\nthat, however intelligent, well-educated, and\nvirtuous, their expulsion from their native\ncountry is a most desirable object, because\ntheir color unjustly deprives them of their so-\ncial rights, and it is determined to persist in\nthat injustice: that no more blacks ought to\nbe made free, except on the condition of their\nexpatriation to the pestilential shores of Gin-\nea: that all attempts to raise the character of\nthe blacks at home ought to be discountenan-\nced: that slavery is a necessary evil : that the\nslave-owners have an undoubted right to hold\ntheir negroes in predial bondage: and, that\ntheir emancipation is not desirable, except in\nplaces where slave labor is unprofitable, or in\nsuch numbers as may keep down the ruinous\nincrease of the slave population, so as to les-\nsen the danger arising from it to the State.\nIn proof that these are the sentiments of the\nprincipal supporters of the American Coloni-\nzation Society, we refer to the North Amer-\nican Review, No. lxxvi., to Mr. Garrison's\npamphlet, and to an article on the Claims of\nthe Blacks in the Eclectic Review for Febru-\nary last.\nMr. Cresson is reported to have styled the\nlast of these an atrocious' article. Mild as\nis our Quaker friend, he can use strong, lan-\nguage. Let him, if he can, disprove a single statement in that article, or his anger will not\nbe construed to the advantage of his cause.\nWe are extremely reluctant to give up our\ngood opinion of Mr. Cresson's motives; but ||\nhis proceedings are fast alienating from him\nthose who have given him the most substan-\ntial proofs of being friends to Liberia, but who\nare enemies to injustice and deception.\nThe fact is, that, in those slave States of\nAmerica, where sugar cannot be cultivated,\nthe slaves have increased too fast; the supply\nis in excess; and the price of slaves has fal-\nlen so low as not to pay for breeding them for\nthe slave-market. Slavery can be profitable\nonly where labor is scarce in proportion to the\ndemand. This has ceased to be the case in\nAmerica. Free labor has driven slave labor\nout of the market in all the Middle States.\nThe slave-owners in these States absolutely\ndo not know what to do with their superfluous\nlive stock. The increase of numbers is\nthus tending to destroy slavery in America.\nHence, the anxiety to counteract that danger-\nous increase by colonization. Hence, the\nmost zealous friends of colonization in Amer-\nica are slave-owners. Hence, too, the prin-\ncipal promoters of the scheme are the great-\nest enemies to general emancipation, and the\nmost illiberal opponents of the claims of the\nblacks.\nDoes Mr. Cresson admit these facts or deny\nthem? Yes or No? If he will not meet Mr.\nGarrison, he must answer us in some shape,\nor he shall be met everywhere with this 'atro-\ncious' picture. It shall haunt him like an evil\nconscience. We are no partizans of Mr.\nGarrison's. We have never spoken to that gen-\ntleman or seen him; we know nothing of him\nbut from his publication. But from what we\nknow of facts, we say again, that Mr. Elliott\nCresson, notwithstanding the countenance he\nhas been so fortunate as to obtain in high\nquarters, will do well fairly to grapple with\nthe charges brought against the Society he\nrepresents, or take his passage for Philadelphia.\n[From the London Patriot of July 24.]\nAMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY.\nTo the Editor of the Patriot :-\nS\u0131r,--By publishing in the Patriot the fol-\nlowing letters, which have been addressed to\nme by two eminent advocates of negro eman-\ncipation, I do not doubt that you will not only\nhasten the liberation of more than two milions\nof slaves in the United States, and the down-\nfall of that brazen hand-maid of slavery, the\nAmerican Colonization Society, but also pre-\nvent many a benevolent and confiding' person\nfrom giving his money to the agent of that\nSociety. For notwithstanding he stands pub-\nlicly charged, by the leading abolitionists in\nthis country, with having misrepresented the\ncharacter and objects of the Colonization So-\nciety, and notwithstanding he has pusillan-\nimously shrunk from the offer of a public dis-\ncussion in this metropolis, to my astonishment\nI learn that Mr. Cresson, in company with an\nIrish female partisan, has either departed, or\nis about to depart, for Ireland, in order to ob-\ntain new charities for a scheme which is 'full\nof all deceivableness of unrighteousness.'\nHappily, the imposture is now generally un-\nderstood; and the speech of the eloquent\nO'Connell, at Exeter Hall, on the 13th instant,\nin opposition to the Society, will anticipate\nthe arrival of Mr. Cresson in Dublin.\nYour much obliged servant,\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.\n18, Aldermanbury, July 22, 1833.\nConway, North Wales, July 14, 1833.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014Our friend, Mr. Cropper,\nwill have informed you of the impossibility of\nmy complying with your request, of sending\nyou an explanation of the causes of my ab-\nsence from your meeting yesterday. I cer-\ntainly would not willingly have been absent;\nfor it was my desire to take every fair oppor-\ntunity of testifying my utter and increasing\ndisapprobation of the principles professed, on\nthe subject of negro slavery, by the American\nColonization Society. I can have no objec-\ntion, indeed, to the plan of colonizing in Af-\nrica, with a view to its civilization, and to the\nextension of Christianity in that deeply injur-\ned quarter of the globe. On the contrary, I\ndesire above all things to see such plans, con-\nceived in the true spirit of philanthrophy, mul-\ntiplying on that coast. But the Colonization\nSociety appears to me to adopt, as the basis\nof its schemes, not the love, but the hatred\nand contempt of the negro race, and to regard\nevery one tinged with their blood as an object,\nnot of kindness and brotherhood, but of ab-\nhorrence, and of exclusion from the common\nsympathies and affinities of our nature, and\nfrom that union and fellowship in that Saviour,\nin whom there is neither Jew nor Gentile,\nBarbarian nor Scythian, American nor Afri-\ncan, black nor white, bond nor free, but we\nare all one in Christ Jesus.\nThe unchristian prejudice of color, which\nalone has given birth to the Colonization So-\nciety, though varnished over with other more\nplausible pretences, and veiled under a pro-\nfession of a Christian regard for the temporal\ns and spiritual interests of the negro, which is\nbelied by the whole course of its reasonings,\nel and the spirit of its measures; is so detesta-\na a\nfree negro.\ncess.\nble in itself, that I think it ought not to be tol-fr\nerated, but, on the contrary, ought to be de- L\nnounced and opposed by all humane, and es-\npecially by all pious persons in this country.\nAnd it especially becomes those who have a\ntaken any active part on behalf of the negro\nrace, whether in this country or in the United a\nStates, to keep aloof from all co-operation\nwith a body whose evident purpose is adverse, t\nnot only to the liberty of the enslaved negro,\nbut to the moral and political elevation of the\nI beg to express my sense of the eminent L\nservices you have rendered to the cause of\nhumanity, by your able and persevering expo-\nsure of the evil tendency of the principles on\nwhich the Colonization Society acts, and trust\nthat\nyour\nexertions will be crowned with suc-\nI remain, my dear sir,\nYours very faithfully,\nZACHARY MACAULAY.\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, Esq.\nParadise Row, Stoke Newington,\n15th of 7th month, 1833.\nEsteemed Friend, William Lloyd Garrison-\nWhen I first heard of the formation of the\ncolony at Liberia, I rejoiced at the intelli-\ngen\u00e7e, not doubting but that it was projected\nand planned by the friends of Africa, with\nfeelings congenial with my own; that its ob-\nject was to promote the civilization of the in-\nhabitants of that vast continent, and make\nsome reparation for the enormous wrongs they\nhad for so many ages endured. This must be\nthe excuse of many in this country, and per-\nhaps in North America also, who have coun-\ntenanced or patronized the American Coloni-\nzation Society. I have repeatedly told Elliott\nCresson that, so far from being an enemy to\nthis American colony, I should be glad to see\ntwenty more of them established, that so a\nmore extended line of coast might be protect-\ned against the slave traders.at having\nheard thy exposition of the origin and main\nobject of the American Colonization Society,\nat the meeting on the 13th instant, at Exeter\nHall, and having read their own printed docu-\nments, I scarcely know how edequately to ex-\npress my surprise and indignation-surprise,\nthat my correspondents in North America\nshould not have informed me of the real prin-\nciples of the said Society; and also that Elli-\nott Cresson, knowing, as he must have known,\nthe abominable sentiments it had printed and\npublished, should have condescended to be-\ncome its agent. My indignation is roused\nwhen I find it asserted in one of their publi-\ncations, that the free people of color consti-\ntute a class, 'out of which no individual can\nbe elevated, and below which none can be\ndepressed. Again,\u2014We have endeavored,\nbut endeavored in vain, to restore them either\nto self-respect, or to the respect of others. It\nis not our fault that we have failed-it is not\ntheirs. It has resulted from a cause over\nwhich neither we nor they can ever have any\ncontrol. Here, therefore, they must be for-\never debased; more than this, they must be\nfor ever useless; more even than this, they\nmust be for ever a nuisance, from which it\nwere a blessing for society to be rid.' Again,\n\"Is it not wise, then, for the free people of co-\nlor and their friends to admit, what cannot\nreasonably be doubted, that the people of color\nmust, in this country, remain for ages, proba-\nbly for ever, a separate and inferior caste,\nweighed down by causes, powerful, universal,\ninevitable, which neither legislation nor Chris-\ntianity can remove?' If it be said that these\nare quotations from the African Repository,\nI understand that it is the ground maintained\nby the American Colonization Society. This\nbeing the case, I cannot but feel indignant\nthat the benevolence of Great Britain and Ire-\nland should have been so imposed upon, to the\namount of the subscriptions obtained under\nthe circumstances stated; and I do hope that\nan account will be called for of the sums sub-\nscribed, and of their application.\nI rejoice that you have formed an Anti-Sla-\nvery Society in New-England, and shall be\nglad to hear that it goes on with increasing\nsuccess. Can you not find some noble spirit-\ned landholders, in your parts, (who have capi-\ntal also,) to set an example of what may be\ndone for the colored free people, by placing\nthem down upon land, and showing them how\nto cultivate it on the spade or garden plan? I\nhave to request thy acceptance of two pamph-\nlets, in which these plans are detailed. The\ncapital employed in this way might be made\nto return with ample interest.\nI remain, with great regard,\nThy sincere friend.\n\"\n\u0e32\nWM\nATTEN",

Oct. 4. 1833.\nMiss Prudence Crandall was brought up\ntrial yesterday, before the Supreme Court,\nover which the Honorable D. Daggett, Chief\nJustice of the State, presided, for harboring\nand boarding foreign blacks, &c.\nThe defence rested entirely on the consti-\nlutionality of the law in question, and when\nthe case was committed to the jury by Judge\nDaggett, the charge presented the most able,\nlucid and conclusive constitutional opinions\never pronounced in this State.\nHe established, by unquestionable legal\ndeductions, the constitutionality of the Con-\nnecticut law, which had before been so much\nmisunderstood.\nThe jury gave a verdict, with little or no\nhesitation against the defendant.\nAll who heard, or who may hereafter have\nopportunity to read this learned exposition of\nthe right of this State to pass the law in ques-\ntion for its own protection, will be satisfied of\nits soundness.'\nWhat will European philanthropists and\nabolitionists say to this? Who can doubt that\nif Wilberforce had lived to attain as the\nNew-York Observer hints-a better under-\nstanding of the Colonization Society, and its\n'moral influnnce,' he would have retracted his\nprotest against it?-Giving due credit, and\nmaking proper alowances for individual in-\nstances of dissent, (including great numbers\nof the uninitiated,) it can no longer be conceal-\ned or denied, that the leading intelligent in-\nfluences of the Colonization Society are\nidentified with the persecution of Miss Cran-\ndall.

                    "ocr_text": "[From the Rhode Island Philanthropist.]\nSTRENGTH OF PREJUDICE.\nMr. Editor, -I am informed (and if incor-\nrectly, should rejoice to be corrected) that the\nRev. Mr. Levington a regularly ordained and\nhighly recommended Episcopal clergyman\nfrom Baltimore, possessing also an untarnish-\ned moral and religious character, was lately\nrefused an admission into the Episcopal\nchurches in this city, to preach the gospel of\nthe grace of God. And what constituted the\ninsurmountable barrier, to this holy messen-\nger of the glad tidings of salvation, from en-\ntering the sanctuary in this city, famed for its\nattachment to the principles of civil and re-\nligious liberty, you may be ready to enquire ?\nWhy, Mr. Editor, it was not because he was\na Calvinist, or an Arminian, nor for any defect\nin intellectual power, or moral worth ; but for\nthat particular kind of depravity which with\nmultitudes never find forgiveness; that sin\nagainst the light (colored gentry) of wearing\njust such a skin as God gave him!! What\nthough the man be as pure as St. Paul, com-\nmissioned by heaven and commissioned by\nthe Bishop to preach the gospel, yet as long\nas he is thus guilty of wearing that nigger\nskin which heaven in mercy bestowed upon\nhim, he shall not degrade the pulpits of our\nEpiscopal churches, in Providence. But if\nhe would only jump out of his skin, we would\nwelcome him with smiles of complacency,\nwith half his present talent and moral integ-\nrity. And does not the church pray for the\ntime to hasten on, when Ethiopia shall stretch\nforth her hand to God? But here is one of\nher sons who has done it and with beautiful\nfeet' upon the mount of salvation, publishes\npeace to a lost world. And when he has thus\ncome near, has he been welcomed by his\nbrethren in Providence, to do the work which\nGod and the church have called him to ? No!\nThe hand of his brethren has been stretched\nout against him, and for this skin depravity, he\nis turned away and denied the privilege of\nworking in his master's vineyard! And does\nGod look at the skin of his creatures in order\nto try their moral character? Mr. Editor, I\nbegin to feel that it is time to rise up, and\nspurn with holy indignation, such a prejudice\nas that which subverts the order of God, mak-\ning the skin of a man the test of moral worth.\nI would ask those who thus rejected Mr. Lev-\nington, where they get divine authority for\nsuch a proceedure? Verily this skin depravity\ntheory would build for Mr. Levington a kitchen\nin heaven, if peradventure he might be admit-\nted within the precients of that \"holy, happy\nplace and keep far from the throne of the\nLamb of God, the purchase of his blood! But\nall this conduct can be justified, Mr. Editor,\nand the questions I have here propounded,\ncan be answered. Yes, the believers and ad-\nvocates of the skin depravity theology, can\nreadily in their own estimation, silence us and\nput us to shame too. And this they effect by\nonly asking us a simple question. This ques-\ntion like the rocks of Gibralter constitutes an\ninvulnerable fortress for them, and like the\ngreat bomb mortar invented by the French, to\nreduce the city of Antwerp, it blows Aboli-\ntionists and their arguments to fritters. It\nsounds so loud that the voice of conscience in\nthose who touch it off, is stilled by it while\nthey seem to stand and clapp their hands in\nexultation to think that it hangs truth and\nrighteousness on the horn of a dilemma !!\nAnd these be it remembered are the words of\nit, . Do you believe in amalgamation?' But\nthe distant rumbling of the thunders of God's\nwrath is already heard. A cloud of fiery in-\ndignation seems fast gathering o'er this land\nand woe betides the man or men, who thus\nlong continue to trample under foot the gol-\nden law of God, \"Thou shalt love thy neigh-\nbor as thyself.' Let the men of liberty, relig-\nion, the men of God, rise up and investigate\nthis system of 'skin depravity,' and see if in\nthe light of God's truth, it constitutes an in-\nsurmountable barrier in the way of those who\nare the subjects of it (by God's appointment)\nfrom enjoying the rights of christians and men.\nDARK COLOR.",

B.\nMundrucu, formerly a major in the Brazilian\nservice, who now resides in this city, and is a\ndealer in clothing, against Captain Baker of\nthe Steam-Boat plying between New Bedford\nand Nantucket. The nature of the action,\nwas for a breach of contract, in not carrying\nthe Plaintiff, his wife and child, together with\nhis horse and Carryall, from New Bedford to\nNantucket, in November last. The facts\nwere that the plaintiff had agreed to pay the\nfull fare in the steam boat, and that after his\nbaggage was received on board, the Captain\nrefused to admit his wife into the ladies' cabin,\nthe Plaintiff being a mulatto, or person of\ncolor, and required them to go forward, which\nthe Plaintiff refused to do. Himself and his\nbaggage were then set on shore, and the\nPlaintiff was obliged to take passage in a\npacket, after some delay. The case was ar-\ngued by David L. Child and Daniel Webster,\nfor the plaintiff, and by C. P. Curtis for De-\n| fendant. The Jury were out four hours, and\nafter receiving further instructions from the\nCourt, returned a verdict for the Plaintiff of\n$125 damages. The Defendant, we under-\nstand, has appealed.\u2014Advocate.\nAnother Murder.-A Mr Clements of New-\nOrleans, was shot a fortnight since, by I. I.\nHall, also of New Orleans, under the follow-\ning circumstances :-Hall it appears has seve-\nral slaves, and one or two colored girls, per-\nhaps free, staying at the bay of St. Louis.\nOne of the latter made use of insolent language\nto Clements, for which he slapped, and perhaps\nbeat her. Hall upon hearing of this, imme-\ndiately started for the Bay, entered the room\nof Clements while he was in bed, and told\nhim that he had come to kill him!-whereupon\nhe drew from under a cloak he wore, a double\nbarrelled gun, and fired at Clements, and was\nonly prevented from firing a second time by a\nnegro man, one of his own slaves. The con-\ntents of the gun lodged in the side of his vic-\ntim, and no hopes are entertained of his re-\ncovery. Hall has been arrested and put in\nprison. STEAM-BOAT NEW-ENGLAND.\nThere were about eighty passengers on\nboard at the time of her disaster, most of whom\nwere fortunately in their berths. Those who\nwere in the gentlemen's cabin escaped unin-\njured, while those on deck, excepting only\nfour or five, were scalded or bruised. The\nladies' cabin being on deck was badly shat-\ntered, and filled instantly with steam and\nscalding water. Every birth in this cabin\nwas occupied, even the settees. Those who\nwere in the after part generally escaped, and\nothers who remained in their berths. Some\nsprang instantly from their berths into the\nscalding water, which for a time was ancle\ndeep on the cabin floor. The explosion was\nsucceeded by the screeches and groans of the\nwounded\u2014the cries of mothers for their chil-\ndren, of wives for their husbands, and broth-\ners and sisters for one another, and for their\nfriends\u2014the bustle and confusion of getting\ndown the boats, to save those who were in\nthe water the whole constituting a scene\nwhich utterly beggars description.\nThe immediate cause of the accident must\nfor a time remain a matter of speculation and\nsurmise. The Engineer was at his post in the\nengine room, and escaped uninjured. He de-\nclares positively that there was not more than\neight inches of steam at the time. The as-\nsistant Engineer says that the guage\nup to the deck. The pilot says, that when the\nboat came to the Saybrook landing, she lay at\nanchor about 20 minutes, during which time\nno steam was blown off, that he felt alarmed\nand went down, and found there was quite\ntoo much steam on,' that once afterwards he\nwent down and found matters nearly in the\nsame condition. The place where the boat\nwas anchored is about six miles below the\nscene of the disaster, and the time that elaps-\ned from her getting under way to her stopping\nat Essex, must have been, at least, half an\nho\u1eb7r. No steam was blown off when she stop-\nped at Essex.\u2014Hartford Review.\nrod was\nWe learn by the papers that Miss Crandall\nhas been convicted before the superior court,\nchief justice Daggett presiding. The judge\nmade an elaborate argument in favor of the\nconstitutionality of the law, by which Connec-\nticut has prohibited the citizens of other states\nfrom resorting to her villages for education.\nWe envy not the feelings with which judge\nDaggett, himself a professing Christian, would\npass sentence of imprisonment upon a Chris-\ntian sister, for the crime of teaching Christians\nthe knowledge that is requisite to qualify them\nfor doing good. Such a man as Jay would\ndoubtless have renounced office for ever, be-\nfore he would have subjected himself to the\nnecessity of executing such a law.-New-York\nEvangelist.\nVarieties of the human species.-The Afri-\ncan blacks are well known to be different from\nthe Europeans, and not more so in the color\nof their skin, than the form of their lips and\nnoses, the hair of their heads, and the shape\nof their legs apland produces no men taller\nthan three cubits; their eyes, ears, and noses,\nare different from those of all other people\nwho surround them. The people of Caffraria\nare of an olive color; the people of Sophila,\nMountbaza, and Melinda, are black, but of a\ndifferent species from those of Niagritia. The\nTartars and native Americans, and the inhab-\nitants of Kamtschatka, have thin beards. Du\nHalde says, the very make of the Chinese\nmouth is different from that of the Europeans;\ntheir teeth are placed in a different manner\nfrom ours, as the under row stands out.\nSLAVERY.-A public Meeting has been held\nin New-York last week, at which upwards of\nthree thousand dollars were subscribed for\nthe purpose of colonizing free blacks in Libe-\nria, or, as the Colonizationists sometimes ex-\npress it, for the purpose of evangelizing Afri-\nca.' We look upon this as so much money\npaid for the perpetuation of slavery in the\nUnited States.

Whatever lessons either of\nthese, or their productiveness when employed\nupon each other, lessens the wealth of the\ncountry. Capital may be employed in two\nways; either to produce new capital, or mere-\nly to afford gratification, and in the production\nof that gratification be consumed, without re-\nplacing its value. The first may be called\ncapital, and the last expenditure. These will\nof course bear inverse proportions to each\nother. If the first be large, the last must be\nsmall, and vice versa. Without any change\nof the amount of wealth, capital will be in-\ncreased by the lessening of expenditure, and\nlessened by the increase of expenditure. Al-\nthough the manner of dividing makes no dif-\nference with the present amount of national\nwealth, it makes a great difference with the\nfuture amount; as it alters materially the\nsources of producing it, the means of an equal,\nor increased reproduction.\nFor instance, a man fond of noise and ex-\ncited agreeably by the hearing of it, pays a\ndollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it.\nHe occasions an entire loss of that amount of\nproperty. Although the powder maker and\nthe merchant, may both have received their\npay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it\nhas been a total loss; and if the sale of it was\nno more profitable than would have been the\nsale of some useful article, it has been an en-\ntire loss to the community. And if by the\nexplosion the man is burnt, partially loses his\nreason, is taken off for a time from business,\nand confined by sickness to his bed, must have\nnurses, physicians, &c. the loss is still increas-\ned. And if he never recovers fully his health,\nor reason, suffers in his social affections and\nmoral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the\neducation of his children, and they are more\nexposed to temptation and ruin, and he is nev-\ner again as able or willing to be habitually\nemployed in productive labor, the nation loses\nequal to the amount of all these put together.\nAnd if his example leads other men to spend,\nand to suffer in the same way, the loss is still\nfurther increased; and so on, through all its\neffects.\nAnd even though the powder maker and\nthe merchant have made enormous profit, this\ndoes not prevent the loss to the community;\nany more than the enormous profit of lottery\ngamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin,\nprevents loss to the community. Nor does it\nmeet the case, to say that the property only\nchanges hands. This is not true.\nThe man\nwho sold the powder made a profit of only a\npart even of the money which the other man\npaid for it; while he lost not only the whole,\nbut vastly more. The whole of the original\ncost was only a small part of the loss to the\nbuyer, and to the nation. The merchant gain-\ned nothing of the time, and other numerous\nexpences, which the buyer lost; nor does he in any way remunerate the community for\nthat loss.\nSuppose that man, instead of buying the\npowder, had bought a pair of shoes; and that\nthe tanner and the shoemaker had gained in\nthis case, what the powder-maker and the\nmerchant had gained in the other; and that\nby the use of the shoes, though they were\nfinally worn out, the man gained twice as much\nas he gave for them; without any loss of health,\nor reason, social affection, or moral susceptibil-\nity; and without any of the consequent evils.\nWho cannot see that it would have increased\nhis wealth, and that of the nation, without in-\njury to any, and have promoted the benefit of\nall.\nThis illustrates the principle with regard to\nardent spirit.\nA man buys a quantity of it,\nand drinks it; when he would be, as is the\ncase with every man, in all respects better\nwithout it. It is to him an entire loss. The\nmerchant may have made a profit of one quar-.\nter of the cost, but the buyer loses the whole\nand he loses the time employed in obtaining\nand drinking it. He loses also, and the com-\nmunity loses, equal to all its deteriorating ef-\nfects upon his body and mind, his children,\nand all who come under his influence. His\nland becomes less productive. The capital of\ncourse produced by his land and labor is die\nminished; and thus the means are diminished\nof future reproduction. And by the increase\nof expenditure in proportion to the capital, it\nis still farther diminished, till to meet the\nincreasingly disproportionate expences, the\nwhole is often taken, and the means of future\nreproduction are entirely exhausted.

Oth-\ners, however, have been undeceived. And we\nmay conceive what was their surprise, and\nwhat their indignation, on learning from the\nbest authority,-namely, the official documents\nof the Colonization Society itself, that they\nhad been duped by its plausible and sinooth-\nspoken representative; that, in fact, so far\nfrom the object and tendency of the Society\nbeing to exterminate slavery, it is framed upon\nprinciples, the inevitable operation of which\nis to prolong slavery to the longest period ?\nAmong those benevolent persons who were\nthus imposed upon, and who have thus discor-\nered the imposture, is Mr. William Allen.\nThey who know this gentleman are well aware\nthat he is not apt to express himself in warm\nand strong language; and yet, so clear and\ndecided are his convictions of the iniquity of\nthe system pursued by the Society on behalf\nof which Mr. Eliiott Cresson has been a-beg-\nging through these kingdoms, that, in a letter\nto Mr. GARRISON, the gentleman who has\ncome over to make us understand the real ob-\nject of Mr. Cresson's labors, he thus expresses\nhimself:\n'I scarcely know how adequately to express\nmy surprise and indignation-surprise, that my\ncorrespondents in North America should not\nhave informed me of the real principles of the\nsaid Society; and also that Elliott Cresson,\nknowing, as he must have known, the abomi-\nnable sentiments it had printed and published,\nshould have condescended to become its agent.\nI cannot but feel indignant that the benevo-\nlence of Great Britain and Ireland should have\nbeen so imposed upon, to the amount of the\nsubscriptions obtained under the circumstan-\nces stated; and I do hope that an account will\nbe called for of the sums subscribed, and of\ntheir application.'\nOur readers are aware that Mr. Cresson has\nrefused Mr. Garrison's challenge to a public\ndiscussion of the merits of the Colonization\nSociety. He may have done this for two rea-\nsons: either because he thought himself une-\nqual to such a forinidable opponent, or because\nhe was inwardly conscious of the indefensible-\nness of the Society which he represents. But\nto the very reasonable demand of Mr. Allen,\nthat he should publicly state the amount of the\nsums he has obtained and how they have been\napplied, Mr. Cresson can have no well-founded\nobjection. If he refuse to comply, the infer-\nence will not be favorable to him.",

                    "ocr_text": "[From the (N. York) Emancipator.]\nTHE PROTEST.\nJust as we expected\u2014the colonization pa-\npers are much excited by the protest from the\ndistinguished philanthropist which we publish-\ned last week. That document will work won-\nders. The last New-York Observer, which\npaper probably speaks the colonization senti-\nments of a great portion of the religious world,\nhas devoted nearly two columns to the subject\nof the protest, and labors hard to prevent the\nmask from falling from the Janus face of the\nColonization Society. But it is too late. The\nObserver attempts to answer the several speci-\nfications of the protest, and says, as an intro-\nductory remark:\n'If our English friends would form a sound\nopinion on the merits of the colonization plan,\nthey must understand the circumstances of the\ncountry; and especially the relations of differ-\nent classes of our population to the subject of\nslavery\nThe editors of the Observer must know, we\nshould suppose, that our English friends' who\nsigned the protest against the American Col-\nonization Society, 'understand what slavery\nin the United States is, quite as well as them-\nselves. It is a system so glaring as to be seen\nand read by all men who have eyes like the\ndeparted Wilberforce--not confined in their\nvision to one country or clime. It will be re-\nmembered, too, that when Mr. Gurley tortured\nthe language of Mr. Clarkson into an enco- mium of the colonization project, the correcto\nness of his understanding of this country'\nwas not doubted at all! Soon he will be found,\nwe are assured, side by side with CHARLES\nSTUART, and other philanthropists, in condem-\nnation of the colonization cbimera: what will\nthe editors say then?\n*\nIt is evident that the name of WILBER-\nFORCE, in connection with a protest against\nthe Colonization Society, has stricken confu-\nsion to the hearts of many colonizationists.\nSainted spirit! thou hast indeed put the cap-\nstone of glory on the monument of thy devot-\ned life. Never may it be forgotten. Wilber-\nforce the best of christians-the noblest of\nphilanthropists-ere he left the scene of his\ntoils for that of his rewards, repudiated the\nwicked project of banishing one-sixth part of\nour population to a heathen shore !\nThe attempt to nullify the protest of Wil-\nberforce comes at too late a day; for the en-\ncomiums passed on his venerated name' by\nthe colonization editors, are hardly dry from\ntheir pens! His name is signed-his seal is\nset-and there they will both stand, while his\ndeathless fame endures, as living testimonies\nagainst the delusive project of African colo-\nnization! Glory to God in the highest that it\nshall be so!\nWe have not space in our columns to fol-\nlow the editors of the Observer through all\ntheir answers to the remaining specification of\nour friends in England.' We have not the\nleast fear, however, of the strictures of the\nObserver. The insinuations that the mind of\nWilberforce was not properly imbued with\nevarfgelical faith,' is as ungererous and unjust\nas it is inconsistent with what the editors had\nsaid in their paper, but a week or two before,\nrespecting the distinguished philanthropist.\nThey will doubtless blush to think of it, ere\nthey die.\n\"If this cruel prejudice does exist among the\nwhites, it forms a powerful reason why they\nwho lament its existence should form a colony\nlike Liberia, 'to serve as an asylum for the poor\nvictims who are suffering under it.'\nThat is to say--we will admit this cruel\nprejudice' cannot be overcome-no-not even\nthrough the influence of the gospel of Jesus\nChrist itself\u2014by gratifying it! Will such a\ncourse at all weaken \u201cthis cruel prejudice'?\nWill it not immensely strengthen and increase\nit? Suppose we could accomplish our object\n--if there were half money enough in the na-\ntion to do it and could hold our colored broth-\ner, who has committed no crime whatever\nagainst us, at arm's length across the waters\nof the Atlantic-would this lessen our preju-\ndice any ? No-the very fact that we had\npower enough to gratify it, would augment it\na thousand fold!\n1",

The first expense\n(could it not be met?) would be the only one; the\npurchase of a plantation which might be worked by\nslaves, who should come under a similar agreement to\nthat noticed above. # * In honor of the noble mar\nwho for so many years has noiselessly and perse-\nveringly pursued the work of prACTICAL CHRISTI\nANITY to a successful issue, and whose praise will\ndoubtless be in the church above, let it be named\nthe McDonogh Institute !.\"\nThat this plan may be fully understood by the\nChurchmen of America, we copy some extracts\nfrom Mr. McDonogh's letter, not contained in the\nSpirit of Missions, being part of his address to his\nblaves :\nThere is but one way, one mode to effect it, tha\nI can see or devise, and that is, by greater assiduity\nand exertions in the slave at his labor during the usu-\nal hours of day labor, and especially by EXTRA HOURS\nOF LABOR BEFORE DAY IN THE MORNING, AND AFTEE\nNIGHT IN THE EVENING. * * * Two hours extra labor\nbefore day in the morning, and two hours after nigh\nin the evening, would be four hours extra in twenty\nfour hours of day, which would be the one third par\nmore of time devoted to labor than is generally de-\nmanded of the slave, which is equivalent to five en-\ntire years of additional and extra labor in fifteen years\nAs the whole of your time belongs to you\nmaster, if he was to permit you to work on a certain\npart of it to make money to purchase your freedom.\nhe would, in reality, in so doing, make you a gi\u017ft o\nyour freedom, which few masters could afford to do\nBut in the mode which I proposu, and now explain\nto you, that you may fully comprehend and under-\nstand it, your master will not make you a present of an\nhour of your time, and you, in reality, will have gain-\ned and placed in his hands, previous to the going ou\nfree, a sum of money arising from your extra labor\nfully sufficient to enable him to purchase AN EQUAL\nNUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH YOURSELVES, MAN FOR MAN\nWOMAN FOR WOMAN, AND YOUTH AND CHILD FOF\nYOUTH AND CHILD.\nGive ear, right reverend bishops of the North, to\nthe pressing wants of your brother of Louisiana.--\nCall on your clergy and people to contribute of their\ncharity to buy slaves and a plantation for his mission\nschool. The first expense (can it not be met ?) wil\nbe the only one. The negroes shall do the rest, by\nextra work before day in the morning, and after\nnight in the evening; and if he shall manage them\nas prudently as 'the noble man' whose praise the\nhosts of heaven are waiting to sing, the southern\nChurch may be enabled, in sixteen years, 'to go to\nVirginia or Carolina, and purchase a gang of people\nof nearly double the number.' Largesse, largesse\nChristians all, for the pet child of the Spirit of Mis\nsions--THE MCDONOGHI INSTITUTE! If we may\nbe allowed to suggest a text for the sermons to be\npreached by our clergy, when this collection shal\nbe made in their parishes, and the advantages to ac\ncrue to the Church from slaves purchased and\nworked by the bishops of the South are held up to\nthe view of their congregations, we would name, as\npeculiarly appropriate, the fourth and fifth verses o\nthe eleventh chapter of Zechariah: Thus saith the\nLord my God, Feed the flock of the slaughtered\nwhose possessors slay them, and hold themselves no\nguilty ; AND THEY THAT SELL THEM SAY, BLESSED\nBE THE LORD, For I AM RICH, AND THEIR SHEP\nHERDS PITY THEM NOT. Should it be thought ad\nvisable, as it doubtless will be, to celebrate the\nopening of \"The McDonO'GH INSTITUTE' with a\ndiscourse from the pulpit, on the blessings it is to\ncall down upon the heads of the founders, there i\na verse of holy writ so clear and explicit, that the\npreacher may speak with perfect confidence on this\npoint. The great Head of the Church has already\nspoken and said: 'Woe unto him that buildeth his\nhouse with unrighteousness, and his chambers wit\nwrong; THAT USETH HIS NEIGHBOR'S SERVICE\nWITHOUT WAGES, AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS\nWORK! If the reverend editor of the Spirit of Mis\nsions should fill the pulpit on this occasion, he will\nof course, attempt to prove, as he now asserts, tha\nno wages ought to be paid, as the masters canno\nafford it.\nA proposition more monstrous than that of the\nSpirit of Missions, we venture to believe, was never\nmade to the American Church. A cool, deliberate\nproposition to Churchmen, to speculate in the bones\nand muscles af their brethren, to make the Church a\ntrafficker in 'slaves and the souls of men.' When\nthe whole world is ringing with denunciations of\nslavery, and the voice of philanthropy is echoed\nfrom the kingdoms of Europe to their colonies of the\nsea: from the northermost parts of Asia to the land\nof Cortez and the republics of the South : from the\nAutocracy of Russia to the Beylic of Tunis, de-\nmanding the liberation of the captive, and justice\nfor the slave, the appointed organ of the Episcopal\nChurch dares to stand forth, the open apologist and\ndefender of that dark system of oppression-to de-\nclare that Christian prudence' demands its contin-\nuance, and to propose that the Churchmen of Amer-\nica contribute to endow a mission school with hti-\nman chattels. What disciple of Machiavelli, whose\nbrazen sophistry puts Jesuitism to the blush, has\ncrept into the Church and assumed the editorial\nchair of its Mission organ, striving to degrade it be-\nfore the world--to gain for it the hiss of scorn, the\nfinger of contempt, and the jeer of the infidel?\n* Aha! aha! art thou become as one of us.' If we\nhad been admitted to orders in the Episcopal Church,\nto preach the truth as it is in Jesus, and had after--\nwards persuaded ourselves that it was expedient to\noppress our brother, if his skin were black, we could\nnot add hypocrisy to unbelief, by continuing to stand\nin the holy place, with the word of God upon our\nlips and a lie within our heart. Were we consis-\ntent, we would doff the robes of our priesthood, and\ndon the mantle of infidelity; or were we honest-\ndid we know the plague-spot within our breast, like\nthe leper, we would bare our head, and rend our\nclothes, and put a covering upon our lip, and warn\nevery Christian from approaching us crying, \"un-\nclean! unclean!!! We would persuade ourselves,\nif possible, that Revelation was a fiction, and Truth\na lie; that the immortality of the soul was but an\nillusion, and future responsibility, a bug-bear of the\nimagination, and then, with a quiet conscience,\ncould we join hands with the advocate of slavery,\nand clasp the slave-trader as a brother, for we could\nassure them, that self was the proper god for our\nidolatry, that expediency was the true rule of action,\nand that our life was but a span, with no eternity to\nfollow. Ay! we too, could we so harden our heart,\nmight trample, like this reverend editor, upon our\nbrother's rights, and treat with scorn, oppression and\ncontempt, the humble brethren of the Redeemer, if\nwe believed no God of justice reigned above, that\nwe might boldly demand, who art thou Lord ?'\nwithout receiving the awful answer, 'I am Jesus\nwhom thou persecutest.'\nThe editor, in a passage quoted by us, expressed\nhis feelings on reading the letter of Mr. McDonogh\n-we will be equally frank and assure him, that to\nsay we have read his comments upon that letter,\nwith deep sorrow, burning indignation, and sicken-\ning disgust, but faintly expresses our feelings. We\ntrust that they will raise such a storm of righteous\nanger among all true Churchmen, as we see by arti-\ncles in the Chronicle and Record,' the New-York\nAmerican,' and 'the Episcopal Recorder, they have\nalready begun to do, that the Board of Missions will\nfully apologize for the infamous doctrines of their\nsubordinate, and as soon as possible remove from a\nsituation he has disgraced, one who has trampled\nupon the holiest principles of the Church, tarnished\nher fair fame throughout the world, and endangered\nthe peace of her members by casting among them\nthe fire-brand of slavery.\nAnd this is the man who pretends to sneer at the\nphilanthropy of a Channing-to compare with his\npure and disinterested benevolence, the pecuniary\nprudence of a slave-dealer. This is the inan who\nmerely intimates that Channing's benevolence was\nheightened by aspirations after a niche in the tem-\nple of Fame, though he well knew that it was when\nthe storm of prejudice howled the loudest, and the\ncry of amalgamation against all who had a heart to\nfeel for the slave was borne upon every brseze, and\nloudly echoed from the pulpits of our land, that\nChanning, counting but as dust in the balance the\npopularity of which he was the idol, and the warm\napproval of endeared friends, manfully attacked the\nmonster slavery, which southern mammou so fondly\ncherishes, and the southern Church so carefully\nguards.\nWhile we lament the errors of Channing's faith,\nhis principles of action were infinitely more ortho-\ndox than those of this man, who, in the name of the\nChurch, unblushingly proclaims to the slaveholders, that they ought not to emancipate their slaves, be-\ncause they cannot afford it!!! On another page he\ndeclares, that the gift of Chtistianity to the slaves\nis an ample recompense for their captivity.' Let him\ngo himself into bondage as a chattel of the mission\nschool, and be repaid by their instruction, for he is\nnot initiated, as yet, into the first rudiments of Chris-\ntianity; and with this advice we hasten to dismiss\nso revolting a subject.\nWe have disclosed fects, which the welfare of ou\nChurch requires should be known, and at which, in\nthe language of Job, upright men shall be aston-\nished.'\nThe establishment of a system of CASTE which,\ntrampling principles under foot, and setting consti-\ntutions at defiance, debars candidates for orders from\nthe Seminary, and excludes clergymen and theit\nparishes from seats in the convention, and continues\nto treat with ignominy the lifeless remains when the\nspirit has returned to the God who gave it, is not on-\nly revolting to every christian feeling, but is start-\nling to those who remember that usurped power\nswells like an avalanche.'* Let the rule be once\nadopted in the Church, sic volo, sic jubeo-stat\nproratione voluntas,'t and we may discard, as useless\nlumber, her Articles and her Canons. The general\ncrouching of our bishops and clergy to popular pre-\njudice, with, indeed, noble exceptions--their fre-\nquent disregard in practice of the golden rules they\nteach, and their withholding of all aid from the phi-\nlanthrohic efforts of the age, will lead many to fear,\nand with justice, that the Church is lagging behind\nprevented by the fears of her ministers from per-\nforming her appropriate work. Such remissness, in\nthe cause of humanity, will lessen the love of her\nchildren, the respect of the world, and the confidence\nof all Christians who may feel and say,\nNon tali auxilio\nNec defensoribus istis tempus eget.'\nMore than seven centuries age, in the year 1102\nin the canons of a council held at London, it was\nsaid, 'Let no man, from henceforth, presume to car\nry on that wicked trafic by which men in England\nhave been hitherto sold like brute animals. And\nthe organ of the Episcopal Church now declares,\nthat the traffic ought not to cease, because the mas-\nters cannot afford it, and bishops sat the example of\nbecoming slave-traders. We are forcibly reminded\nof Cameades, a Cyrenian philosepher, who was sent\nby the Athenians as embasssdor to Rome, and there\nargued before the niagistrates and people with great\npower and eloquenee in praise of justice. The next\nday, to establish his doctrine of the uncertainty of\nall human knowledge, he undertook to refute his\nformer arguments and prove them false; whereupon\nthe Senate, fearing that he would corrupt the morals\nof the nation, sent him home. Our pro-slavery cler-\ngy would seem to belong to the school of this phi-\nlosopher, but they have carried his doctrines to an\nextent never dreamed of by their founder. By main-\ntaining, at the same time, Christianity and slavery\nthey would show, if it were possible, not the uncer\ntainty of human knowledge, but the baseless chame-\nlion-like character of divine truth and eternal prin-\nciple. The time has been when we were liable to\nbe duced into vice by infidels and atheists, but\nnow it is the gowned priest and the mitred bishop\nwho teach us by their precept and their example, to\nenslave our brethren upon christian principles, and\nact the tyrant in the name of God.\nSince this article has been ready for the press-\nthe April number of the Spirit of Missions has been\npublished, in which it was fully expected the Mis\nsion Committee would disavow the infamous propo-\nsal of the editor, that the Church should become a\nspeculator in human flesh. Not one word upon the\nsubject do we find. The Board of Missions, through\ntheir committees, have adopted it as their own-\n*The CHURCH,' as represented by the Board of Mis-\nsions, approves the plan. May God pardon those\nwho so misrepresent her! We trust due notice will\nbe given of the day when collections are to be made\nin our parishes to establish this brokerage in the\ntrade of blood, which to Mr. McDonogh has yielded,\ndespite the hardness of the times, CENT PER CENT\nMan for man, woman for woman, youth and child\nfor youth and child;' and in that same hour let the\nprayer ascend from every Christian in the land, to\nour common Father, beseeching him to grant that\nHis Church, being always preserved from false apos-\ntles, may be ordered and guided by faithful and true\nshepherds.'|| To you, right reverend bishops, to you\nreverend presbyters, to you, all true Churchmen\nclerical or lay, whether dwellers at the North or\nSouth, whether distinguished as high or low, do we\nappeal, earnestly, deeply, affectionately appeal, to\nrise in your might, and vindicate the purity of our\nHoly Faith.\nIt may be a grave question for your consideration,\nhow far this formal rejection of the first principles\nof Christianity, this annihilation of the law of love,\nare to be regarded not only among the vestigia mo-\nrientis libertatis-the footsteps of departing liberty\n--but as signa cailentis ecclesice --the signs of a fall-\ning Church\nWe should not be surprised, if this vindication of\nthe doctrines and honor of our Church, should be\nstigmatized, even by some among her dignitaries, as\nfanaticism. To all who may be disposed thus to\nbrand it, we say in conclusion, in the words of that\nroble prelate, Bishop Horsley, Beware, my lords,\nhow you bring under the opprobrious name of fanat-\nicism, the great duties of justice and mercy, for the\nneglect of which, if you should neglect them, you\nWILL BE ANSWERABLE AT THAT TRIBUNAL WHERE\nNO PREVARICATION OF WITNESSES CAN MISFORM\nTHE JUDGE, WHERE NO SUBTLETY OF AN ADVOCATE\nMISCALLING THE NAMES OF THINGS, PUTTING EVIL\nFOR GOOD AND GOOD FOR EVIL, CAN MIRLEAD HIS\nJUDGMENT.\nA CHURCHMAN.\n* D'Aubigne.\n+ As I wish, so I command, my will stands in the\nplace of reason.\nNot such aid nor such defenders, do the times\nneed.\n$ Wilkin's Concilia.\n|| Collect. for St. Matthias's day.",

By this last act,\nNew-York acknowledged the constitutional ebligation\nto deliver up to their masters all fugitives from labor,\nas soon as they were proved to be such. But this did\nnot suit the views of certain negro-catchers, who\nvery well knew that they could not prove to a jury\nthat free colored citizens of this State were slaves.\nVirginia, in the same year, demanded of Gov.\nSeward the delivering up, as felons, of three color-\ned citizens of New York, who had assisted a slave\nto escape, and who were falsely charged upon oath\nwith having stolen hin The Governor very proper-\nly refused to surrender the men, as the charge was\nevidently a palpable lie, and then the Ancient Do-\nminion' thought it not derogatory to her dignity, to\npass an act subjecting all vessels from New-York\nto inspection, on the ground that every ship-captain\nwas a thief, and, unless narrowly watched, would\nsteal slaves; and the costs of this examination was\nall charged to the New-Yorkers; thus affording an\nopportunity for creating new and lucrative offices\nfor political partisans at our expense.\nvided by this act, that it should become null and\nvoid, as soon as New-York should give up the three\ninnocent sailors to vengeance, and also repeal the\njury law.\nThe light in which this outrageous law was re-\ngarded by many in Virginia, may be seen by a pas-\nsage from the Richmond Whig of February 17.-\nWe thought, and have frequently expressed the\nopinion, that the action of Virginia was, if not un-\nconstitutional, undignified, and unworthy of the\nCommonwealth. One might have supposed that\ninsult thus added to insult, would have aroused\nsome little particle of indignation in the democratic\nlegislators of our State; but their patience and hu-\nmility almost equal those of Job. The present\nGovernor, in his message, recommended the repeal\nof the jury law; and a majority of the committee, to\nwhom it was referred, made, in February, a report\nin accordance with his wishes, but so thoroughly\nservile, that even their own party were ashamed to\nacknowledge it, and referred it back to them. They\nhave since modified it, and the report has been again\ndiluted and emasculated, but still the same. We\nsuppose it is all right. Servility is the order of the\nday. We are the lacqueys of the South, and must\ndo as she bids us. Let bis Excellency, Governor\nBouck, hunt up the three poor sailors, as a peace of\nfering to the high and mighty majesty of Virginia.\nLet the Legislature repeal the jury law, and give\nfree scope to kidnapping, and then Virginia will be\nIt was pro- graciously pleased not to regard our captains as\nthieves, and not to steal money out of their pockets.\nWhen our democratic Legislature have thus bow-\ned the knee to slavery, and faithfully performed its\nbidding-when they have prostituted the honor of\nthe people of their State, and stripped from our col-\nored population the last shred of protection which\nnow shields them from the grasp of the kidnapper,\nwe trust they will complete their work. Having\nbartered away our dignity and independence, it\nwere worse than idle to retain the name. Let them,\nbefore adjourning, change the title of New-York to\n\"The Craven State,' and substitute for her motto\n* Excelsior,' the more appropriate one of 'Miserere !\nFrom the Universalist Repository.\nThe Christian Examiner.\nThe issue for March presents two exceedingly\nvaluable articles-- Slavery,' and 'The Early Lite-\nrary History of Christianity,' by Revs. A. P. Pea-\nbody and G. E. Ellis. The article on slavery is an\nearnest and powerful production. It dissects the\nabominable foolishness of a writer in the Southern\nReview,' who endeavors, not to apologize for the\nperpetuation of the patriarchal institution, but to\nlegitiinize it as a divine ordination, against which\nwe should not, and against which we cannot virtu-\nously contend! He maintains that the Canaanites\nwere doomed perpetually to be a servile race --\nhewers of wood and drawers of water; the modern\nAfricans, he tells us, are the descendants of the Ca-\nnaanites, and heirs of the curse ; and to this it is\nadded, that the Creator has constituted them, boriy\nand soul, to be such; in support of which opinion,\nthe anatomist and psycologist are appealed to. The\nargument is briefly thus:-Noah's curse on Ham\nwas prophetical and perpetual ; the present negro\nraces are identically the same as the Canaanites;\nthe negro is, from necessity, more under the influ-\nence of his instincts, appetites, and animality, and\nless under the influence of his reflective faculties,\nthan other races of men; the negro's eye has an an-\natomical contrivance, by which a membranous wing\ncovers a considerable portion of the globe of the\neye, when he is exposed, as he must be, to the hot\nsun; in the negro's nature is provided a principle of\nprotection aguinst the exactions of a hard master, by\nmaking it impossible to force from him more than a\nmoderate amount of service ! --and next we are as-\nsured that the slaves are entirely contented with\ntheir condition, and have no desire for freedom.-\nThe review of this presumptuous and impious arti-\ncle, is one of the most earnest and right down sen-\nsible articles on the subject of southern slavery we\nhave ever read. How different as a specimen of\nreasoning and argument from the article in the same\nNo. on the Destruction of the World by Fire!",

                    "ocr_text": "The Letter of Dr. Dionysius Lardner.\nBRUNSWECK, April 1st. 1843.\nTo RICHARD YEADON, Esq:\nMy Dear Sir-I have seen a correspondence be\ntween you and Dr. Lardner, an Englishman travel\nling in the United States, who intends to write\nbook;' and have read it with much the same feeling\nas I suppose some persons will read the Doctor\nbook, when he has made it. Some part of the lette\nto the Doctor seems, however, to be rather gratuitous\nparticularly that part which entrenches piracy be\nhind the patriarchs and Jehovah, Jesus and Paul\nfor it appears that the Doctor does not mean to med\ndle with the morality of the subject, but to confin\nhis observations to the mere animal. I cannot bu\nnotice that an indignity is offered to the gentleman?\nunderstanding, in several parts of your letter of Jan\n7th, but I apprehend no such thing was intended\nand if perceived by him, will not be noticed till th\nbook appears.\nI apprehend, my dear Sir, that you labor under\nslight misapprehension in some of the ideas expres\nsed in the above letter, for you say, that you can\nprove your slave system, to any unprejudiced mind\ntruly patriarchal, &c.-If so, it has improved im\nmensely since the abolition movement commenced\nfor before that time, it was TRULY DIABOLICAL; and\nI rejoice that the efforts of these true friends of bot\nmaster and slave have tended so greatly to amelior\nate the condition of the latter, and to harmonize the\nformer. But I cannot avoid believing it to be ne\ncessary that a mind should be quite prejudiced in fa\nvor of the system of oppression, to be susceptible o\nany such proof, although it may be that the defini\ntion of such words as prejudice, piracy, robbery, and\nsome others, vary, like the climate, according to lat\nitude and longitude; and this, I am aware, is the\ncase with regard to apparently some very plain and\nsimple language; for, in your reference to the case\nof Onesimus, which has been misquoted by the ad\nvocates of slavery all over Christendom, please to\nnotice, first, that if Onesimus was a chattel, he was\nnot sent back as such; for the apostle says of him\nWhom I have sent again.' How? As a chattel\nNo. As a slave? No. As property? No. Non\nas a servant, not as a SLAVE. How then? As\nBROTHER beloved,' as an EQUAL, as my own\nself.? Now, my dear sir, I am aware that this epistle\nis misquoted and misapprehended, not always inten\ntionally, but because the Bible is a sealed book a\nthe South, in consequence of the stultified condition\nof the moral perceptions, induced by the selfishness\nwhich is the necessary fruit of the exercise of un\nlimited power, and the desire to perpetuate it, and so\nthose little but very significant words which I have\nquoted escape notice, although the whole sense o\nthe letter depends upon them. If, then, the aboli\ntionists, who feel such devilish sympathy' for those\nhappy birds of paradise, can once have as full an as\nsurance that the patriarchs of the South will even\ndo more than they shall ask, as Paul had of the\nready acquisence of Philemon in the case quoted, i\npromise you that we will imitate his example joyful-\nly, whenever a slave comes among ns, who has run\naway from his corn, and sweet potatoes, rice, ground-\nnuts, poultry, eggs, &c; and will not only endeavor\nto convert him (for that must be done first,) but, when\nconverted, send him back to his peaceful, happy and\nEden-like lot, with the consciousness that he is not\na mere animal, but a MAN; and with the assurance\nthat he will be looked upon, not as a chattel, not as\na thing, but as an equal with the white man, socially\nand civilly. And we shall rejoice to have them all\nrunaway in their turn, that we may convert them\nand send them back unfettered, disenthralled, FREE.\nSlavery would thus be abolished, and the quandam\nslave stand forth in all the dignity of MAN. And\nhe will, under such circumstances, truly rejoice to\nreturn; for I have never seen a fugitive from slavery,\nwho did not declare, that if slavery were abolished,\nhe would immediately go back;' the climate being\nmore congenial to his constitution and habits, than\nthe cold regions of New-England and the British\nprovinces. It is but a few days since we had an op-\nportunity of imitating the example of Paul in the\ncase of another Paul, who came here from the South,\nand who said he would return if he conld do so and\nbe free; but under the existing state of things he\nrefused to be converted, and we were under the ne-\ncessity of assisting him to secure an asylum in the\ndominions of the Queen. A peck of corn a week,\nor a bushel of sweet potatoes,' seems to me rather\nscant fare for a laboring man, and no doubt the salt\nmeat, or salt fish, occasionally, is quite a rarity; but\nI am not sure that this simple fare may not be cal-\nculated to render them physically and morally better,\n(provided they have enough with time to cook it\nproperly,) than if they were indulged in the gourman-\ndizing habits, for which the whites are so notorious,\nthat the answer to the question in the catechism, (if\nthey have one,) What is the chief end of man?\nmight properly be-Idleness and gluttony.\nI am glad, my dear Sir, to learn that they are fur-\nnished, of course,' with summer and winter clothing,\nfor previous to the abolition movement, the young,\nduring the summer were, of course,' left in a state\nof perfect nudity: so here I recognize another in-\nstance of the improving influence of our labors; and\nin relation to the commission of crime, I have the\nmost unshaken confidence in what you say upon\nthat point, (not because you say it, but because it is\nconfirmed by better evidence ;) for I believe that\nthey are morally far superior to their masters, as a\ngeneral rule, and I likewise rejoice to know that you\nhave no fears of having your throat cut, for before\nthe abolitionists began to manifest the devilish\nsympathy' which so disturbs your quiet, there was a\nvery general fear upon that subject; and we have\nthe evidence of how inuch better, both morally and\nphysically, these people would be as free citizens,\nwhen the distant hope of freedom, some time or other,\nfor themselves or their children, can tend to allay\nthe cause of dread which the oppressor always must\nfeel, when he contemplates the sense of wrong\nwhich rankles in the hearts of his victims. I sin-\ncerely wish, my dear Sir, that they may never hurt\na hair of your head in any case, but that when they\nlock you up, as you say they do at night, they would\nkeep you locked up and feed you upon\ncorn a week, or sweet potatoes, with occasionally a\nlittle salt meat, or salt fish, till slavery were abolish-\n5\npeck of ed; and of this case I truly wish it might be said,\net uno disce omnes throughout the whole South.\nI have no doubt of the exceeding love the slaves\nhear to those who use their services without wages,\nand give them not for their work, and separate hus-\nbands and wives, parents and children from each\nother, at will, and sell them like cattle in the market:\nI have heard some of them describe that love,) and\nI have sufficient evidence of their panting desire for\nfreedom, under any circumstances, in the account\ngiven by one John McDonogh of the emancipation\nof his own slaves, detailed by him in the New-Or-\nleans Bulletin, though he was unquestionably the\nbest master in all the South.\nBut it is not the mere physical condition of the\nslaves that excites the devilish sympathy' of aboli-\nlitionists. It is their moral state and the inoral state\nof the slaveholders, which is much the worst of the\ntwo. Your invitation to the Doctor, who intends to\nwrite a book, to visit your plantation, that El Dorado\nof the slave, to see them lock you up at night and\nJet you out in the morning, is quite as amusing as\nthe way a lady in New Orleans gulled a gentleman\nfrom Bath in tbis state. She asked him to come and\nsee her children, and he went; and behold in an\nelegantly furnished parlor, playing on a Brussels\ncarpet, were two little woolly heads, with each a\ngreat chunk of pound cake in its hand.\nBut, my dear Sir, dont allow yourself to imagine\nthat the anti-slavery movement will be retarded,\nmuch less arrested, by any of these flimsy devices.\nThey only proclaim, in language not to be misun-\nderstood, that the temple of the horrid Moloch is\neven now tottering to its foundation, and re-\nmind me of the gnat that seated himself on the horn\nof the bull and imagined his weight to be a barden,\nbut was informed that neither was his presence felt,\nnor would his absence be perceived. We shall\nsurely redouble our efforts to prostrate the now tot-\ntering and crumbling edifice, and we acquire new\ncourage at such manifestations of its weakness, as\nthe correspondence between yourself and the learn-\ned Doctor afforis\nDismiss from your troubled soul, my dear Sir, all\napprehensions of any horrible results from abolition,\nexcept the horrible thought which robbers naturally\nfeel at being obliged to obtain their bread by honest\nindustry. We seek to effect our object entirely by\nmoral means, and are fully determined never to in-\nterfere with either masters or slaves in any other\nmanner. Of the siaveholders, not one is fit to die;\nand our efforts are directed to reach the consciences,\nand thus influence the conduct of all that are not\ngiven up to perish in their own delusions; for no\nprinciple will be settled, no moral object attained by\nabolishing slavery in any other way.\nBe assured, dear Sir, that we perfectly understand\nand intend to observe the principle of non-interfer-\nence, to which you allude as though we had viola-\nted it. We well know that we have nothing in a\nlegal or legislative point of view to do with your be-\ngetting your own chattles, or trading in the bodies\nand souls of your own sons and daughters in the in-\ndividual States. But we have something to do with\nit in the national capital, and we shall not cease to\nurge its abolition there, which we have a right to do\nand we intend to observe our duty to fugitive slaves\nand to their professed masters; that is, we mean to\nimitate Paul, when we are sure that the patriarchs\nwill emulate Philemon, and the slaves imitate One-\nsimus, in voluntarily returning and carrying our let-\nters to the master. But if slave-hunters follow their\nfugitives here, and attempt to take them, we shall\nuse no force to prevent them; but they will get no\nhelp in New-England, and the fugitive has the same\nright to defend himself that any other man has.\nWe have done quite enough with our blood and\ntreasure' to sustain kidnapping and piracy, but de-\npend upon it the North never will, ' in the very im-\nprobable emergency' to which you refer, move a\nhand or foot to arrest it; you must take care of your\nselves. This is fast becoming the settled policy of\nthe whole North.\nIn less than five years slavery will be abolished\nin the District of Columbia; the northern churches\nwill separate from the southern on that question, and\nthe plague-spot will soon pass away. In this you\nwill no doubt rejoice with us.\nThe fiat has gone\nforth. MenE, MENE, TEKLE,' is written upon the\nwalls of the citadel of oppression.\nA few years ago a solitary young man sent forth\nthe first sheet of the periodical in which this letter\nis published. It contained the following language\nwhich time has proved was prophetic. Let south-\nern oppressore tremble. Let their secret abettors trem-\nble. Let their northern apologists tremble. Let all\nthe enemies of the persecuted blacks tremble. I am in\nearnest. I will not equivocate. I will not ercuse. 1\nwill not retreat a single inch. AND I WILL BE\nHEARD. That young man was WILLIAM LLOYD\nGARRISON. You have heard of him, perhaps. AE\nthis time, his coadjutors number a host, animated\nby a like determined and unconquerable spirit.\nTheir number is constantly increasing, and they\nmust and will triumph.\nYours in the hope of the downfall of all oppres-\nsion,\nD. S. GRANDIN.\n1",

                    "ocr_text": "Anti-Slavery in Indiana.\nANGOLA, Steuben Co. (Indiana,) March 20, 1843.\nBROTHER GARRISON: We have recently re-\nceived a letter from the committee chosen to\ngive more extensive circulation to the Liberator\nThe few who read the Liberator, in this part of the\nworld, have long felt the importance of the subject\nThere is great need of knowledge in anti-slavery\ntruth. The Western world is asleep on the subject\nof American slavery. The indifference manifestec\nby the religious and political partyists of this coun-\ntry is more universal and fatal than in the Eastern\nStates. Gross darkness covers the people, and re-\nform is impossible where there is such ignorance.\nThere are but few, even of the leading politicians\nof the country, that have any perception of the cause\nand origin of the troublous times that now oppress\nthe nation. In their minds, reform must begin with\nlegislation. This is the prescriptive nostram with\nwhich the aspirants to national office buy the votes\nof the unthinking, yet honest mechanic and farmer\nof this land. The people think that systems of law,\nconcocted by representatives and senators at the\nState capitol, have some magic power to alleviate\nthe woes and sufferings of the nation. They scarcely\nconceive that ceasing to do evil, and learning to do\nwell, is an essential prerequisite to wholesome leg-\nislation; and except local legislation proceed from\nsuch a source, no relief can be realized.\nSo long as such recklessness for humanity rules in\nthis State legislature as to suffer such foul blasts, in\nregard to colored people, to stain the statute book,\nthe people of the State cannot reasonably look for\njust and honest legislation for themselves. Noth-\ning but the deepest degradation in ignorance can\nallow of their electing men for office, who connive\nat such things. To pass over such injustice is to\nscoff at and tantalize the earnest entreaties of the\nsuffering poor white man, who prays for legislative\nrelief for himself. What man can be so foolhardy\nas to strive for and against the same thing? But\nall that meet to vote pro-slavery men into office, to\nmake a system of laws for the nation, must assuredly\ndo it. Time is fooled away at every day of elec-\ntion; and the man that advocates the idea of voting\non such principles is cursing the world. Certainly\nnothing but good and truth can purge the world;\nthen all efforts to do good on wrong principles are\nnot only abortive, but positively detrimental; who\nconfess legislation will not secure the happiness of\nsociety. Those who will legislate only for a class in\nthe community will forsake that class when it is for\ntheir interest. No man can love a white man that\nhates a colored man. He that will not legislate for\nthe colored man, ought not to have my franchise-\ncannot be trusted with the rights of the nation\nwill involve in ruin his friends, when his own pri-\nvate interests, disconnected from all mankind, de-\nmand it. If we will vote, let the first thing de-\ntermined on be, 'Are you willing to do what justice\nand mercy require ?' Then, whatever wrongs the\nman of color endures, will be removed; and this\nwould constitute alone evidence that the man will do\nme justice in legislation.\nThe priest comes forward and asserts that religion\nis man's salvation. The anxious-seat is our hope of\nredemption. To mourn religiously and popnlarly\nfor sins will alleviate human woe, though it confirms\nus in the practise of forging chains and erecting\ngallows. The clergy preach that man is divinely\ndivided into grades, and the one shall be the ser-\nvants of the other. The dupes of such clerical vil-\nlany are contented to serve, and to force others into\nthe service. The priest proclaims a common pa-\nrentage, common God, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and\nthen basely tramples in the dust the dearest rights\nof the great mass. This part teems with priests as\nmuch as ever France did. All are contending for\ntheir part of the people. The crowd swallow their\ndivine prescriptions as though they were heavenly\nantidotes given the aristocracy by the direct com-\nmunication from Deity. There are so many divine\nteachers here, that only a few are left to practice.\nThe heavenly oracles uttered are expected to benefit\nonly those who are of like sentiments; so each re. ligious demagogue does not anticipate honor from\nany, until he has converted them to his faith. The\nholy days here are occupied by all varieties. One\nman preaches Christ in one way, another in another\nway. The stomach and brains of the populace are\nso crammed by the Jesuits with religion, that hu-\nmanity sounds like phariseeism. To talk of science\nand literature, temperance, justice, human rights\nfor both male and female--in fine, to say that the\nperfection of the social system, the establishing of\ntruth over the ruins of slavery, was the great end\nChrist had in living and dying in this world-is\nFrench infidelity, and will confirm man in a still\ndeeper degradation than he is now. Religion alone\nis the antidote for suffering, and that religion dis-\nconnected from all acts of humanity. The Sabbath\nmust be consecrated to God, ever at man's expense.\nNothing that will do good to the body and intellect\nof man ought to be spoken on the Sabbath. Re-\nligion should sanctify the day. He that would pre-\ntend to talk of the slave pining in chains, the drunk-\nard wallowing in the mire, or brutalizing his family-\nor to meet for the cultivation of the science of mu-\nsic, is sacrilegious, and a defamation of God's cha-\nracter, and shows a want of reverence for his holy\nname. The nation meet for the blessing of Jehovah\non Sunday; then, and as soon as the clerical robe is\nthrown off, curse humanity. Here the clergy advise\nmost devoutly the advocates of humanity to save\ntheir breath' for more honorable purposes than the\nlow, dirty calling Jesus Christ was engaged in-i.e.\npreaching deliverence to the captives, and the un-\nbinding the heavy burdens. The clergy here defame\nthe name and character of any that attempt to do\nany thing for the relief of human woe beyond dom-\nination. They stand aghast at the discussions for\njustice and equality of the human family ; for when\nall are perfectly scientific, which will be in perfect\norganization of Society, then there will be justice,\nand there will be no need of a clerical aristocracy\nto preach faith and Sunday holiness\"; for then all wil\nbe led by science to love their neighbors as them-\nselves. What consternation would fill the ranks of\nthe clergy! There would be nc occasion for clerical\nexhortations, and a large class in society would be\nthrown out of employ, driven to the necessity of man-\nual labor, or open theft.\nNow they commit theft, under cover of an as-\nsumed divine warrant. The order of priests neces-\nsarily implies slavery. There must be slaves to\ntoil for their support, so long as they maintain their\nstanding. Slavery will never cease, so long as there\nis such an abusive idea in regard to the clergy. To\nsay that they have rights above others, implies a de-\nprivation of rights in others, consequently inferior-\nity, not of mental or physical energy, but of artifi-\ncial, unjust immunities, concocted, and mutually\nconferred by the rich and powerful.\nThis is almost all that is done for the cause of\nman's redemption in this State. The priest can\npray, shout, sing psalms, and bring society to their\nknees; and then suffer them to imbrue their hands\nin a brother's blood. The politician talks of honest\nlegislators, and then nominates himself as a fit leg-\nislator. This is the whole of the labor attempted\nhere. Both are foolish, selfish, and unconcerned\nfor those whom they persuade to be their supporters\nThey do not care for their supporters as men, for\nthen they would care for any man. They regard\nnone but partizans. He that will pay the clerical\ntax, and defend the clergy with concern for their\nwelfare, will meet the approbation of the clergy.-\nThe inquiry is, whether he is of the same party, and\nfaithful ; if so, then all is right. Nither thinks of\nhumanity. The priest would fear that his black\nsuit would be tarnished to pray for the colored man.\nAnd, indeed, a prayer from such a man would fal\nupon the limbs of the slave like a blighting simoon\nTo think of reforming society with such means is\nthe height of absurdity. Corruption increases unde\nsuch influence. The politician desires the offices\nof government, but he gives no evidence that he is\nfitted for them. He will not seek by his legislation\nto relieve the distresses of the people. We hear the\nman preach, and he tells us of being born again,\nloving God, being damned if we do not believe, being\nburnt, without being consumed, in an ignitable lake\nof brimstone; all this, and much more. But we do\nnot see them doing as they would be done by; we\ndo not hear them advising men to fly the sin of sla\nvery, and all the abominations of injustice. They\nsay, 'Get religion, but they say you can sell your\nbrother; love God with all your soul, even if you\nhave to curse man with all the malignity the tongue\nis capable of.\nThe nation is convulsed by politics and religion,\nand those who will not pray, and sanctify the holy-\ndays, and attend elections, are execrated as unfit for\nsociety; whilst the slave clanks his chains under\nthe pulpit, and in the capital of American liberties.\nNow, either the politics and religion of the land are\nspurious, or else truth is not purifying in its nature\nThe latter is surely true; of course, then, we must\nseek salvation from the corruption of society, from\nsome other means than by popular notions of reli-\ngion and politics. Truth will save us; then we are\nall believing a lie. The more zealous for religion\nor politics an individual is, the more fatal to the in-\nterests of humanity will be his toil. The more that\nis done wrong, the worse will be the condition of\nthose to whom the wrong is done. This nation is\nsuffering by excessive legislation, and on account of\nincrease of religions. Let there be less of the pres-\nent politics and preaching, then society would come\nto their senses. Each would think more for him-\nself; and then there would be more intelligent\naction. Instead of the foolish, unintelligible ser-\nmon, let there be a developing of the wrong of the\nsocial system, and means devised for the correction\nof them; then mankind will begin to realize salva-\ntion. So long as the Sabbath is made the only day\nto meet together upon, and nothing concerning the\nwoes and miseries of society to be discussed on that\nday, so long shall we feel the present throes with-\nout hope of deliverance. We have long enongh\nlooked for deliverance in another world. This idea\nhas long enough been swallowed by the sects,\npalmed off on them by the vicegerents of heaven.\nIt is time for us to experiment for present salvation.\nThe burden and woes of human being are becoming\nintolerable. All that is necessary is to throw off\nthe burden. Let us turn our backs on these dumb-\ndogs, (D. D.'s,) and such as are Licensed to Lie\nDreadfully, (L. L. D.'s,) and spend the time of as-\nsembling on the Sabbath, and other times of con-\ngregating, for the purpose of finding out means for\npresent relief; then will this world assume a new\naspect. Then slavery and war, chains and swords,\nscourges and gallows, soul-drivers and hangmen,\nwould call on the rocks and mountains to hide them\nfrom the face of truth and its triumphs.\nPRENTICE H. EVANS.\nN. B. We want more light. My Liberators are\nseized and read with avidity, as soon as received.\nThey are constantly on the wing until worn out.-\nTalk to my neighbors of taking it--- Hard times' is\nthe answer. We intend to meet and form a Society\nsoon, and will do what we can to extend its circui-\nlation.\n3",

It is a little singular that those who,\nin most respects, have been such staunch support-\ners of that original platform,' (the Declaration of\nSentiments,) should now refuse to encourage the\nlabor of freeman rather than that of slaves, by giv-\ning preference to the productions of the former.\nViewing the subject in the light of either duty or\nexpediency, their course is equally inexplicable. How\nthey can, with any regard for consistency, demand\nthat our political and ecclesiastical skirts be redeemed\nfrom the pollution of slavery, and yet (by direct en-\ncouragement where it could so readily be avoided)\ndaily and hourly participate in lending a deeper hue\nto the crimson of our commercial garments, is to me\nan enigme, I have vainly endeavoured to solve.\nTrue, the impossibility of tee-totalism, in this respect,\nhas been urged, and thence it has been argued that\npartial abstinence was unnecessary. By what pro-\ncess of logic this conclusion is obtained, it is diffi-\ncult to discern, unless by the application of Frank-\nlin's maxim, Whatever is worth doing at all, is\nworth doing well.\nAs a matter of expediency, a measure to be adopt-\ned or forsaken, as the interests of the cause demand,\nI know not of a single good reason why abstinence\nshould be abandoned; but, on the contrary, as a\nmeans eminently calculated to promote discussion\nwhenever it is openly practised, and discussion be-\ning the vital atmosphere of true abolitionism, it fol-\nlows that this measure is highly conducive to a\nhealthy condition of the cause ; and, moreover, by\nconsistency in this respect, we destroy a handle,\nwhich our opponents would otherwise effectually\nuse for our overthrow.

Endicott presented a resolutior., which, after\nbeing amended, was accepted for consideration, in\nthe following words:\nResolved, That the conduct of the American\nchurch, in sustaining the bloody system of American\nslavery, in the light which is blazing around it, and\nin its hostile attitude to abolitionism, proves it to be\nthoroughly anti-christian; and therefore no coun-\ntenance can be given to the pretensions or claims of\nthat church, as a christian body, by any who fear\nGod and work righteousness.\nWm. Lloyd Garrison presented the following reso-\nlution:\nResolved, That they are without excuse, who\ncountenance and support a pro-slavery church, or a\npro-slavery minister, on the plea that they must sup-\nport public worship and the institutions of religion,\nand that they are so situated in a pro-slavery com-\nmunity, that they cannot do otherwise ; for as all\ntrue worship is performed in spirit and in truth,'\nand is not at all dependent on time, place or associa-\ntion-and as a pro-slavery church or a pro-slavery\nminister is manifestly of the devil-to pursue this\ncourse is to support a frightful imposture, to make\nthe Almighty at war with himself, to do evil that\ngood may come, and to sanction religious hypocrisy\nand pharisaical formality in their most hateful forms.\nThe following resolution was also presented for\ndiscussion, by another member:\nResolved, That inasmuch as the success of the\nanti-slavery enterprise depends upon the circulation\nof truth through the community, it is the duty of ab-\nolitionists to assert the right of speech to its utmost\nextent, free from the control of any human authority ;\nand whoever endeavors to prevent the exercise of\nthis right, wars against the best interest of the\nslave.\nThese resolutions elicited a very animated and\nspirited discussion, in which Brs. Garrison, Buffum,\nRemond, Burleigh, Endicott, Brown, Austin, Tan-\nner, Wright, (of England,) Cutter, Bassett, Harri-\nman, Hood, Kittredge, Hunt, and others participated.\nA resolution was presented, and, while under dis-\ncussion, a messenger from Abner Sanger informed\nthe meeting that the Convention could not have the\nuse of the Hall in the evening, as he (Sanger) did\nnot like the manner in which it was conducted. It\nwas ir mediately\nVoted, to adjourn the Convention, to meet at the\nEngine House at the New Mills, at half past 6\no'clock.\nAt the adjourned meeting, the following resolu-\ntion was presented by Abel Tanner, and discussed\nby the mover and others, and adopted :\nResolved, That Abner Sanger, by ordering out of\nhis Hall the Anti-Slavery Convention because it re-\nfused to conduct its proceedings according to his\nnotions of anti-slavery business, committed a gross\noutrage on the principles of human rights, and gave\na cruel stab to the cause of the bleeding slave, and\nto this Convention conclusively proved himself to be\nno friend to human freedom.\nJOSEPH MERRILL, Chairman.\nWILLIAM EVERETT, Clerk.",

The passage of a bill to be engrossed\nin the House, without a division, to prohibit the use\nof the jails of Maine to claimants of fugitive slaves,\nand imposing a heavy penalty on the judicial offi-\ncers of this State, who may take any part in arrest-\ning and restoring a fugitive slave, marks an era in\nthe progress of public opinion on this subject.-\nWhen the bill came up on its first reading, a motion\nwas made to postpone it indefinitely. A discussion\nfollowed, it that can be called a discussion which\nwas all on one side, for no one defended the report\nof the majority of the joint committees, or spoke\nagainst the bill. It was advocated by Messrs. Hart\nof Portland, Severance of Augusta, Grant of Litch-\nfield, and Morse of Wilton, and no one replying, the\nmotion to postpone indefinitely was negatived by a\nlarge majority. The next day, as we have said, the\nbill passed without a division.\nAfter the above was written, the bill came back\nto the House from the Senate, that body having re-\nfused the bill a passage. The House insisted on its\nformer vote.--Kennebec (Me.) Journal.",

                    "ocr_text": "Daniel O'Connell.\nIn a copy of the Dublin Morning Register, of Oct.\n18th, 1842, (for which I am indebted to some un-\nknown friend, I find reported a speech made by\nDaniel O'Connell, at a meeting of the Loyal National\nRepeal Association, held in the Great Rooms, Corn\nExchange, from which\nselect the following extract,\nrespecting American slavery, and myself as the advo-\ncate of emancipation :\nHe would, before he sat down, say a few words\nupon another subject, which he deemed of some\nimportance. (Hear, hear.) He had lately got a great\nmany American newspapers which came at present\nfrom that country at a very trifling expense, merely\nthe postage from Liverpool, and he perceived in some\nof those papers that complaints had been made of\nhim by the abolitionists on the ground that he had\ngiven credit to rumors circulated to their prejudice\nby the slave-owners and pro-slasery party in Arner-\nica. (Cries of hear, hear.') It was unnecessary for\nhim to state that he was as much opposed to slavery,\nin every shape and form, and in every clime, as any\nhuman being that ever existed; but he would not\nsanction immoral means for the achievement of the\ngreatest good that mankind could enjoy. He did\nnot believe the rumors, with regard to the abolition-\nists, which had been generally circulated ; but when\n;\nit was stated that some of them had encouraged the\nslaves to commit theft and other crimes for the pur-\npose of escaping from slavery, he, of course, con-\ndemned such means being resorted to even in the\npursuit of freedom. He did not mix up his cause\nwith that of the abolitionists in America; but no\nman in the world hated slavery more than he did,\nand none of them were more anxious for its total ab-\nolition. (Cheers.) Then, why should he further\nbind himself up with them in anything but the abo-\nlition of slavery, and that by moral means only? He\nsaw in some of those American papers that a Mr.\nLloyd Garrison, one of the leading abolitionists, bad,\nat a public meeting, proposed the abolition of Sun-\nday, and the setting aside of all clerical authority in\nmatters of religion. That might do very well for\nMr. Garrison himself; but when he sought to make\nit general, and thus encroach upon the most solemn\ncommands of God, it was not too much to condemn\nsuch a course. It was alleged by the supporters of\nslavery in America that it was an institution of their\ncountry, and ought not to be interfered with. That\nwas a mere idle play upon words; and, even if it\nwere an institution, that was the reason why it\nshould be more speedily abolished. It was stated,\ntoo, that the English had bequeathed slavery to them.\nThe same silly pretext might be used with regard to\nall the cruelties and injustice that were practised by\nthe English in Ireland from one generation to anoth-\ner. He hoped that the odious name of slavery would\nsoon be at an end in America, and that no such\nprinciple as the aristocracy of color would ever be\nacted\nupon, there or in any other part of the world.\nHe was grieved to see that at the anniversary of the\nAmalgamation Society, in Pbiladelphia, when the\ncolored men were met to celebrate the First of Au-\ngust, 1838, they were attacked and treated with the\nnost atrocious cruelty by the people of that city ;\nand it increased his sorrow to find that Irishmen, who\nvere themselves so long the victims of oppression,\nhad joined in that attack. They first attacked the\nAmalgamation Society, but had more recently at-\nfacked those poor colored men when they had met\nbo celebrate the anniversary alluded to. Shame upon\nthem, both American and Irish! and where, he\nvould ask, were the Catholic priests, and that dis-\nfinguished and holy order, the Jesuits, who, in all\nparts of the world, have been celebrated alike for their\nearning and love of liberty? Why did they not\nraise their voice against this iniquitous proceeding,\nbr, if they could not have done so in time, why did\nhot they raise one plaintive tone of sorrow for the\ncommission of such crimes before the face of Hea-\nven? He had thus thought it right to say so much\nupon the subject of slavery in America, as he had\nbeen accused of relaxing his efforts in its favor; but\nhe need hardly again repeat that, whilst he had life,\nhis best energies would be directed to blot out the\nfoul stain from the earth, and to give every man of\nevery color and of every clime a perfect equality of\nright. (Luud cheers.)\nI shall make but a very few comments on this sin-\ngular extract:\n1. It is gratifying to learn, from the lips of Mr.\nO'Connell, that he is determined never to be bribed\nnto silence, on the subject of American slavery, by\nany of the devices of the pro-slavery \u00b7 Repealers' in\nthis country, who, by sending money over to the Na.\ntonal Repeal Association, from time to time, accom-\njanied with remonstrances against bis denunciations\nof American hypocrisy and oppression, have evidenily\nhoped to seal up his lips.\n2. It is equally gratifying to perceive, that, in re-\ngard to the atrocious cruelty exercised, by a lawless\npopulace, on the persons of the colored inhabitants of\nPhiladelpbia, on the 1st of August last, he does not\nsbrink from justly and severely censuring those of his\nown countrymen, who were among the active perpetra-\ntors of that cruelty ; nor from reproving the Catholic\npriests and Jesuits, belonging to Philadelphia and\nelsewhere, for not having raised their voice against\nsuch an iniquitous proceeding.\n3. Mr. O'Connell refers to a statement made against\nsome abolitionists in this country, that they had en.\ncouraged the slaves to commit theft and other crimes\nfor the purpose of escaping from slavery; and assu-\nming this charge to be true, he very properly con-\ndemns such a course. It is needless to tell our readers\nthat no such encouragement has ever been given to\nour slave population. The lie, we believe, was first\ncoined in the mint of the New-York Observer, and\nhas since been circulated very extensively by the en-\nemies of the anti-slavery enterprise --most certainly\nnot because they had any repugnance to theft and\nother crimes,' provided slaves and niggers' were the\nonly sufferers, (for they are at this very hour re-\nligiously striking hands with thieves, and consenting\nwith adulterers,') but in order to obstruct the progress,\nand if possible destroy the life, of that merciful and\nmagnificent enterprise. This defamation Das grown\nout of a letter, addressed to the slaves of the South,\nwhich was written by GERRIT SMITH, of Peterboro',\nand adopted at a large meeting of abolitionists in west-\nern New-York, in the course of last year. Whatey-\ner may be thought or said of the expediency of wri-\nting such a letter, which could not be read by those to\nwhom it was addressed, and the advice of which, in a\nsingle particular, pro-slavery malice could so easily\ntorture into crime, still, in our opinion, no honest and\nhumane mind, no one who loves his neighbor as him-\nself, or who remembers those in bonds as bound with\nthem, can peruse that letter, and then attribute to its\nauthor any other than the most praiseworthy inten-\ntions and commendable feelings \u00b7 I am sure, if Mr.\nO'Connell could procure a copy of it, he would not\nhesitate to endorse that feature of it, wbich has been\n50 grossly misrepresented to him. I have a slight re\ncollection of being told, by my worthy friend James\nCannings Fuller, (now on a visit to England,) some\ntime since, that Gerrit Smith had sent a letter to Mr.\nO'Connell, in reference to the remarks which are con-\ntained in the extract above cited, on encouraging\nslaves to steal. If I am correct, and Mr. Smith will\nsend me a copy of that letter, I shall esteem it a priy-\nilege to publish it in the L berator-and also the re-\nply to it from Mr. O'Connell, if any has been re-\nceived.\n4. It will be seen that Mr. O'Connell has misap-\nprehended not only Mr. Smith's views in relation to\nfugitive slaves, but also my own respecting certain\nreligious matters. By whom his mind has been con-\nfused and poisoned, on this point, I do not know. I\nonly know that an enemy hath done this.' Bui\n?\nt\n5\nn\nn\n1\n1\nt\ne\n-t\n-\ne\na\ne\nk\n8\ne\nn\nd\n8\n5\n23",

What\nwould he think or say of me, i\u017f, in a public meeting,\nwhilst alluding to the glorious Repeal struggle in Ire-\nland, I should refer to Daniel O'Connell, one of\nthe leading' repealers, and hold up some of his peen.\nliar Catholic sentiments to condemnation and abhor-\nrence? Would he not deem such conduct, in such a\nconnexion, on such an occasion, extraordinary,\nunmanly, almost unpardonable?\nWhatever may\nbe my views respecting the Sabbath and the clergy,\nthey are not cherished or propagated by me as an ab-\nolitionist, but as the Lord's freeman.' I am charged\nby him with seeking to make these views general.--\nHave I not a right to do so, without being denounced\nwhen unti-slavery is the theme? But he ventures to\naffirm that I wish to encroach upon the most solemn\ncommands of God,' and therefore deserve to be con-\ndemned. In this he is mistaken. He and I may,\nand unquestionably do, differ somewhat as to the\ncommands of God,' but I assure him that I am anx-\nious to keep them all inviolate. But when he us-\nsumes that one of these is to bow to clerical autior-\nity in matters of religion,' I candidly tell him that I\nr know not where that command is to be found. Nay,\nmore-I tell him that I am as hostile to clerical as I\nam to slaveholding autherity; and I place these au-\nthorities in the same category, excepting that I be-\nlieve the former has done incomparably more mis-\n- chief to mankind than the latter. They are both of\n1 the devil, and are both destined to fall into the bot-\ntomless pit. So long as the human race bow to\nclerical authority, in matters of religion,' their dam-\nnation is sure. The distinction of clergy and laity is\na pestilent heresy. It is unknown in the new cove-\nnant dispensation, in the church of Christ, in the\nkingdom of God. To that dispensation, church and\nkingdom, I profess to belong; and by the grace that\nis given to me, I am resolved to unmask those wolves\ne\nin sheep's clothing, those spiritual impostors, those\n. Christ-dishonoring usurpers, who assume to exercise\nclerical authority' over the consciences of men. As\na distinct body, as a clergy, their downfall is as cer-\ntain and irrevocable as the overthrow of slavery.\n\u2022 Their glory and their miglit\nShall perish-and their very names shall be\nVile before all the people, in the light\nof\nOf the world's liberty !\nAs to the Sabbath, it is quite remarkable that Mr.\nt\nO'Connell, being a Catholic, should refer to it with so\nit\nit\nmuch apparent veneration, seeing that the Catholic\n1. Church allows of the desecration of that day in the\nmost revolting manner. How is the Sabbath observed\nin countries where the Catholic religion bears sway?\n\u0443 Undeniably, in a manner by no means in accordance\nd\nwith the assumed sanctity of the day. I am not for\nh\nits abolition as a day of rest, but for redeemiug the\ne whole week from the bondage of toil, by the removal\n1. of those heavy burdens which sin and a ralse religion\nhave fastened upon the shoulders of the human race,\nand which it requires six days of brute labor to sus-\ntain. My views of the Sabbath are essentially coin-\ne\ncident with those of Luther, Melancthon, Calvin,\n0 Tyndal, Paley, Belsham, Priestly, Fox, Barclay and\n, Penn; but, as a Catholic, Mr. O'Connell will natural-\ne\nly regard these names as not of any special authority.\nHe will perceive that I do not complain of him for\ncherishing views conflicting with my own, but for run-\nning a religious tilt against me, as a repealer and an\nabolitionist, on an occasion not pertinent to such a\n11 pious display. He knows what is ineant by the phrase,\nir\ntravelling out of the record.' Every thing at the\not\nright time, and in the right place.\nd The reporter makes him allude to me as a Mr. Lloyd\nGarrison.' This is a small matter; but coupled with\nthe religious objurgation which fell fro:n \u015fhis lips, it\nh\nlooks intentionally invidious. Certainly, I am no\nd\nstranger to bim, either on the score of notoriety, or of\nit\nes\npersonal acquaintance. In all my interviews with\ne him, he has always received me in the most hearty\nof and flattering manner; and never as a man, as an A.\nof\nmerican citizen, and especially as the advocate of my\nenslaved countrymen, shall I cease to remember with\na grateful heart, and to appreciate in the most exalted\nsense, the testimonies he has borne, the labors he has\nr. performed, the personal aid he has afforded me and\ned my anti-slavery coadjutors, the untiring zeal and moral\nby intrepidity be has manifested, for the immediate and\nin eternal overthrow of American slavery, 'the vilest\nthat ever saw the light of the sun, and the sum of ail\nvillanies.'\nn\nr\ne\nn\nn\nr\n1,\n.\n0\n-\ne\ne\n-\nt-\net\nn\n\u0435\nS-\n\u0435\n1-\nn-",

They can no longer speak in its meet-\nings, nor vote in its councils, and thus luse entirely\ntheir means of changing its course.\nThis looks like a strong argument.\nIt would be so,\nif ecclesiastical relations were the only ones which\nbind men to each other. But they are neither the\nonly onus, nor, in themselves, the strongest ones;\nthough, by the way in which slavery has corrupted\nthem, they are now the strongest obstacles to its abo.\nlition. The ties of blood are stronger. So are the\nrelations growing out of matrimony, and trade, and\nneighborhood ; and all these remain after the\nchurch tie is dissolved. If to all these be applied the\ninfuence of a body of persons purified from the sin of\nslavery in virtue of their renunciation of the church\nfrom which slavery has driven away the spirit of\nChrist, the result will be far more favorable to the\nprogress of anti-slavery truth, and the extinction of\nslavery itself, than could be hoped from their remain-\ning in unity with a church wirich they have labored\nin vain to influence.\nThis is the theory respecting the expediency of\ncoming out and and being separate\nfrom any pro-\nslavery influences which we wish to destroy. It is\nas applicable to the Constitution of the United States\nas to the covenanis of the sects. Whether the words\nof church-covenant or State-covenant are pro-slavery\nor anti-slavery words, is of the smallest consequence.\nWhat is their practical working, is the only question\nto which abolitionists attach much importance. That\nboth are practically used by our people to sustain and\nfoster slavery, no abolitionist doubts; and ne finally\nf\nforbids the people so engaged, to count him among\nthe number of supporters of any of the Constitutions\nand covenants which they so misuse. He becomes\nconvinced of the sin of partaking of their deeds :-he\ndetermines not to be tormented with their plagues,\nIn illustration of the correctness of this theory\nstand the following facts which transpired in a town\nd\nnot a hundred miles from Boston,' as parliamentary\ncockneyism was wont to say, and which pirrase we\nwill use to save needless personality. The town in\nquestion is one where anti-slavery principles were\ne\nearly planted, and where a pro-slavery church and\nminister Inbored constantly for their destruction.\nThese labors were sometimes successful; for the min-\nister called and still calls bimself an abolitionist, and\nhence frequently deceived even the real abolition\nspirit that was springing into being in his church, with\nthe idea that now was nou the right time, nor the an-\nr. ti-slavery cause in the hands of the right men, nor the\naction of churches against slavery the right measure.\nBut the cause flourished in spite of all opposition-\nand numbers of abolitionists came out and were\nd separate.' The church whose course they could\nnot influence by remaining within it, is perceptibly\nce changing its ground before their increased influence\nsince they left it. Kecently, one of its members, hav-\nDe ing removed to the South, requested a letter of recom-\nal mendation to a church there. Conscous that they\nwere closely observed by the world about them, and\ne,\nby the members who had left them on account of their\ns- subserviency to slavery, the best of the remaining\nmembers, under such an influence from the purer\nn,\nsource without, made renewed exertions, and procured\nnd this proviso to be added to the usual form of recom-\n1-mendation ;-that it should be presented to no slave-\ny\nholding church\nWe pretend not to give a description of the painful\n7- process of finding out what goes on in men's minds\nin before they see the necessity of renouncing slavery in\na its church robes, if they would succeed in their grand\ne, purpose to gain its recognition as a sin--to put the\nne branding iron upon it as an immorality: nor of the\nmighty struggle between cant and truth,--twaddle and\n-d humanity,---hypocrisy and sincerity,--false logic and\nth right reason,-sectarianism and religion,-a righteous\nit man's life and a recreant church's interests. It was\n20 not our present purpose to picture the kingdom of the\nof buman soul in its state of revolution under the influ-\nthence of all the holy principles which oppose slavery ;\nty nor to give a history of the downfall of one of the pet-\n1. ty spiritual despotisms which the age is to out-grow.\nny We have merely selected a single illustration from the\nth many, of the fact that THE RIGHT IS ALWAYS THE\nedEXPEDIENT.M.

In that case, it is admitted on all hands\nthat they must be left to pursue their dreadful trade\nun molested. The claim of Great Britain is to ascer-\ntain by the inspection of the papers of a slaver, wheth-\ner she be really American, or whether she be British,\nor of some other nation, whose slave-trading pirate\nships Great Britain has the right by treaty to capture.\nExcept the United States, there is not a single chris-\ntian nation, of any maritime importance, that has not\nstipulated with England for the mutual right of search,\nfor the suppression of the slave trade. Slave traders,\nlike other pirates, are always provided with a variety\nof flags, and run up that which will best conceal and\ncover their wicked business. In consequence of the\ntreaties above mentioned, and the laws made in pur-\nsuance of them, it has now, ard for the three or four\nlast years, come to this, that our flag is precisely the\nBEST for their purpose. All the treaties are, there-\nfore, a complete nullity, if there remain one flag un-\nder which the slave trading subjects of the parties to\nthe treaties can still take shelter. Suppose, for ex-\nample, that our revenue laws were in force in every\ndistric: of the United States, except Boston, and that\ngoods of any kind, and to an unlimited amount, might\nbe introduced there free of duty; what would the vast\nmachinery of custom-house laws and custom-house\nofficers be worth in the other districts ? Not a\nfartbing; nay, it would be a waste of millions of\nmoney, and of the time of thousands of able hands.\nI will not enlarge upon the subject in this letter, in-\nasmuch as I have been engaged since the adjourn-\nment of Congress in examining it in connexion with\nother matters of great interest, in relation to which I\nhope in a few days to offer you the result of my la-\nlabors.\nBut the attention of abolitionists cannot be too soon\ninvoked to the dangerous issue, to which the diplo-\nmatic correspondence of this and the British govern-\nment is tending. Rely upon it, my friend, it means\nwar! war for the maintenance and extension of sla-\ne\nf\nvery! Mr. Webster, to my inexpressible grief, has\nnow committed himself along with John Tyler, the\nf\nold Eastern Shore slave-breeders, Caleb Cushing, and\nThomas H. Benton, to this unhallowed scheme.-\nNothing but a seasonable understanding, and a\n3\ndetermined resistance the part of freemen\nof the free States can save, I will not say the\nslaves, but our country, from destruction and de-\nspair. The British will not recede the one thousandth\npart of a hair from their position. A war with us on\nA\n7\nthe ground now rashly and wickedly assumed by our\nf\ngovernment, becomes indispensable to carrying out\nthe great and humane policy to wbich the British\npeople liave dedicated themselves more than to any\nother object, for a quarter of a century. And what\ndo our government now demand of that govern-\nment and people? To arrest, in mid volley, the\nthunder launched at the man-stealing pirate - -\nIt may not be; it will not be. And are we, parad-\nventure, going to take that thunder on our buck-\nler to screen the pirate? That is our present attitude.\nMay God of his great merey avert the awful conse-\nbuences, which I fear.\nD. L. C.\ns\non\n2\n1\n9",

And when ye see the south\nwind blow, ye say, there will be heat; and it cometh\nYe hypocrites ! ye can discern the face of\nthe sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye cannot\ndiscern this time? Yea, and why, even of yourselves,\njudge ye not what is right?' LUKE XI. And there\nshall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the\nstars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with\nperplexity, the sea and the waves roaring: men's\nhearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those\nthings that are coming upon the earth; for the powers\nof heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see\nthe Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and\ngreat glory. And when these things begin to come to\npass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your\nredemption draweth nigh. Behold the fig-tree, and\nall the trees ; when they now shoot forth, ye see and\nknow, of your own selves, that summer is now nigh\nat hand : so, likewise, when ye see these things come\nto pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at\nhand.\nSurely we may discern, in the events that are pass-\ning in the world and around us, that the kingdom of\nGod is at hand; and we have occasion to lift up our\nheads, rejoicing that the day of redemption draweth\nnigh. The stone that was cut out of the mountain\nwithout hands, has smitten the great image on its feet,\nand it is fast crumbling, to become like the chaff of the\nsummer threshing.floor, to be carried away by the\nwind.\nI am not astonished that, in an age like the present,\nwhen men look for the kingdom of God to come with\nobservation, a great portion of the community, in\nview of the signs of the times, should look for a lit-\neral mundane overthrow; seeing that the world have\nso long refused to have the Lord Jesus Christ to reign\nover them, and have been continually legislating, both\ncivilly and ecclesiastically,to multiply laws that should\nanswer their purposes better than those of the King of\nkings; inasmuch as they have sought to exalt their\nthrones above the stars of God, and to be like the\nMost High; and to build temples to their idols, that\nshould reach to heaven. And it surprises me as little,\nthat multitudes who have continually taught these\nthings, now revolt at the thought that the time of the\nend draweth nigh; for they have each boped that,\nin the end, their own beloved sect, like the rod of Mo-\nses, would have swallowed up all the others, until\nwhich they could not comprehend how universal and\neverlasting righteousness could reign in the earth.\nIn these days of apostacy, while men are contend-\ning for wealth and power, and seeking honor of one\nanother, how can they discern the signs of the times?\nThe signs in the sun, moon and stars, or the commo-\ntions in the civil and ecclesiastical establishments;\non the eartl), distress of nations, with perplexity,\nwhich all must see, but cannot comprehend ;-the\nsea and the waves roaring, in turbulent commotions,\nand outbreaks of angry multitudes of peoples and na-\ntions ;---the devil coming in great wrath, in the con-\nvulsive fury of mobs and riots, because he knoweth\nthat he hath but a short time; for the saints of the\nMost High are on the march to take and possess the\nkingdom forever and ever, according to his promise.\nThey go forth in the name of Him who saith, He that\novercometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to\nhim will I give power over the nations, and he shall\nrule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a pot-\nter shall they betroken in pieces. Not with such rods\nof iron as swords, bayonets and guns, which kill, de-\nstroy, and make desolate; but with that sharp double-\nedged rod of everlasting truth, which goeth out of the\nmouth of Him that sitteth on the white horse, who is\ncalled Faithful and True, and in righteousness doth\nhe judge and make war.\nThe sectarians of the present day cannot discern\nthe signs of the times; for the same reason that they\nwho lived when the Lord came in the flesh could not\nthen discern them. How can ye believe, who receive\nhonor one of another? This blinding influence shuts\nup their moral vision, lest they should see with their\neyes, and bear with their ears, and understand with\ntheir hearts, and forsake their idols, and he should\nheal them, and they should walk in the light of his\ntruth, and enter into spiritual rest: for they huve no\nrest day nor night, that worship the beast and his\nimage.\nHad man continued in the state of Eden, there\nnever could have been a necessity for Christ's coming\nin the flesh. That truth which Jehovah had given\nhim as the law of life, would have been so followed\nthat he would have enjoyed constant communion with\nGod and fellowship with his neighbor, doing unto ev-\nery one as he would desire every one to do to him.\nIn such a state, sectarianism could not enter; for all\nwould have been perfect in love. A proposition so\nself-evident, that, without argument, it demonstrates\nsectarianism to be of the devil, and each individual\nsect must trace its genealogy to the same origin.\nChrist came to restore man to the state of love, and\nfellowship, and unity, and communion with God;\nand he gave him such precepts as, being followed,\nnecessarily lead to that glorious end. His doctrine\nwas,\nthat ye resist not evil; but if any man smite\nyou on the right cheek, turn to him the other also ;\nand refuse not to him that asketh, any thing that you\nhave power to grant. Give to him that asketh, and\nfrom him that would borrow of thee, turn mot thou\naway; and love your enemies.'\nHad the world received, and allowed themselves,\nas they became acquainted with the teachings of the\nLord Jesus, to be governed by them in all their lives,\nwe never should have heard of bis Second Advent;\nfor the universal reign of righteousness would then\nhave been established in the earth; man would have\nbeen re-established in his primeval condition, and\nwould have enjoyed constant communion with God, and\nfellowship with his neighbor; and sectarianism, and\nslavery, and war, with their ten thousand woes, would\nhave ceased to blast the happiness of mankind, and\nmake this world a pandemonium. The Lord taught\nhis disciples to pray, 'Thy kingdom come, thy will\nbe done, on earth, as it is done in heaven. This\nprayer is used by all sects of the present day, as far\nas I know, (except one, who do not pray, Thy king-\ndom come,' believing that it has come ;) but are they\nsincere? Touch their sect, and you touch the apple of\ntheir eye. In their opinion, you strike at the salva-\ntion of a lost world; without them, the ga:es of heaven\nare closed against the human race.\nWhat sect is there\nin existence that does not conceive that their destruc-\ntion, as a sect, would seal the deep damnation of\nthousands of immortal souls? Yet they still pray that\nthe Lord will overturn, and overturn, and overturn\nuntil he come; who\u0161e right it is to reign. But their\nmeaning is, that he will overturn all but themselves.\nEach sect claims to be the chosen people of God, al-\nthough he may have some people in other sects. They\nacknowledge that there are no sects in heaven; no\ndivisions about non-essentials; but that all are glori-\nfied saints, dwelling in love and oneness; and they\npray, Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on\nearth, as it is done in heaven.' There are no forms\nand ceremonies there ; and thus they pray that sects,\nand forms, and ceremonies, and ordinances, may\ncease, and that the earth may be full of holiness; yet\nthey continue to strive, at the expense of truth and\nrighteousness and justice, mercy, and the love of God,\nto retain that state of things on earth, which they ac-\nknowledge does not and cannot exist in beaven. War,\nslavery, and domestic oppression are the weapon\nwith which they march under the banner of the drag.\non, to fight against Michael and his angels; but they\nshall not prevail.\nAs in the days of his flesh, the Lord called those to\nproclaim his truth who were not of the established\norder of public teachers of that time; so, now, he has\nput the work of propagating anew in the world, his\npure and unadulterated truth, into the hands of men\nwho are rejected and opposed by the ecclesiastics of\nthe present day, that they may preach glad tidings\nto the meek, that they may bind up the broken-\nhearted, and proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to pro-\nclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day\nof vengeance of our God.' These cannot fail to meet\nwith the most violent hostility from those ecclesiasti-\ncal powers, who, like the chief priests of the Jewish\nage, appear righteous outwardly, but within are full of\nhypocrisy and deceit, and cannot understand how men\nand Christians can be governed by the law of love,\nwithout the agency of the sword, and the religion of\nfear and selfishness.\nTo abolish oppression, slavery and wrong by the\npure application of heaven-born truth, without the\nagency of sectarian organization and power, is to their\nbeclouded perceptions no less an enigma, than was the\ndeclaration of the Lord, that it were easier for a camel\nto go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man\nto enter the kingdom of heaven; and they responded,\n\u2022 Who then can be saved ?'\nIn the adoption of the principles of Christ, that ye\nresist not evil, but if any smite you on one cheek, turn\nto him the other also,' they profess to foresee the most\ndireful and bloody consequences. Poor blind souls !\nWho will shed those rivers of blood ? Surely not the\nfollowers of Jesus; not they that refuse to defend or\navenge themselves. Then, if blood flows, it must be\nshed by these very ecclesiastics, or those who embrace\nand follow their teachings, in preference to the teach-\nings of Him who was led as a lamb to the slaughter.\nWho will enslave the helpless ? Not they who main-\ntain that man cannot be the property of man, and will\nnot contend by force, either legal or physical, to secure\nand maintain their own rights, even though they die.\nBut these are the beginnings of the things that must\nshortly come to pass; for the Lord is about to send\nthe rod of his strength out of Zion, to rule in the midst\nof his enemies, to break in pieces all nations as with a\nrod of iron, to destroy \u00b7 The Man of Sin' (ecclesiasti-\ncal power) with the brightness of his coming,' to\nbring in everlasting righteousness- and his people\nshall be willing in the day of his power.'\nAlready is the world convulsed with these truths.\nAlready do the powers of darkness tremble at their\nutterance. The time is near at hand wlien the Son of\nman shall be seen coming in the clouds of heaven,\nwith power and great glory, to take vengeance upon\nthe hypocrites and the ungodly. And shall this nation\nescape, whose sins have reached to heaven? Whose\nguilt exceeds the guilt of any other nation under the\nsun? Who, in her civil capacity, has stood perjured\nbefore the face of heaven and earth, in all the promises\nshe has ever made both to God and man? Who, in\nher religious capacity, has made a covenant with death,\nand an agreement with hell? Who has sought to de-\nthrone the Most High, and, like Ahab, has done evil\nmore than all the nations of the earth? The seed of\ndissolution which she planted in her infancy, has be-\ncome a tree bearing the fruit of the bottomless pit, and\nis now blossoming for destruction. The rod is lifted\nover her head, and she will be the first to fall beneath\nthe hand of an AVENGING GOD.\nShall I not visit for these things ? saith the Lord.\nShall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as\nthis?'\nBut, in the midst of this desolation, will the truth\nof the Most High be cherished and followed as the\nbeacon-light of salvation, by them that trust in his\npower and grace; and they will be found watching\nfor the bridegroon: at his coming. The signs of the\ntimes declare that the redemption of his faithful ser-\nvants draweth nigh. Lift up your heads, and rejoice,\nall ye saints of his; for his kingdom, which is an ever-\nlasting kingdom, and his dominion, which shall have\nno end, will be established upon the ruins of the pow-\ner of the prince of darkness, and the saints shall take\nthe kingdom, armed with the word of God, and the\npower of his love, and possess it forever and ever.\nD.

I am confident\nthat the friends of social reform would be unwilling\nto have their meetings clash with the anti-slavery\nmeetings. The probability is, that most of those,\nfriendly to social reform, would like to attend the\nanti-slavery meetings also. That the reform meet-\nings were notified to be holden at the same time with\nthose of the American A. S. Society was entirely my\nown fault. I received a request from the Committee\nof the Society of Inquiry and Reform' to notify,\nthrough the press, that the first annual meeting would\nbe holden anniversary week. I accordingly issued\nthe call, without reflecting that the meetings would\nbe likely to clash.\nWill you be kind enough to alter the call for the\nmeeting, to commence on FRIDAY, May 12th, in-\nstead of Wednesday, the 10th ?\nYours, truly,\nJ.

The denouement took\nplace on Wednesday, 5th inst.\nFor several days he had feigned to be unwell, and\nhad applied to the Physician of the Prison for medi-\ncine. The latter, not having the fullest confidence in\nthe reality of Edwards' indisposition, advised him to\ntake an emetic. To this, Edwards objected, and said\nthat he would sooner jump into the river and drown\nhimself. He however on Wednesday concluded to\ntake the emnetic, and was sent across the yard to a\nHospital pertaining to the Prison, to procure it. In a\nfew minutes thereafter, one of the convicts near the\nriver called out, - A man in the dock! A man in the\ndock !' He at the same time reached a long pole in-\nto the water, and called to the drowning man to seize\nit. A number of persons ran towards the scene of the\ntragedy, and on their arrival, the convict pretended\nthat the man had just sunk. Near the place lay the\ncap of Edwards, with a paper in it, upon which was\nwritten, .The deed is done.'\nThe river was forth with raked thoroughly for the\nbody, and a search made in every part of the Prison,\n'bui in vain until yesterday morning, when Edwards\nwas found concealed in a large box in the shop in\nwhich he worked. There was a shelf in the middle\nof the box, on which he lay. On rouring him out, he\nwas found to be supplied with provisions for three\ndays, and also a quantity of brandy. It was evident\nhe had an assistant, and from a letter discovered on\nhis person, suspicion rested on an agent of one of the\ncontractors, who had been arrested when the steam-\nboat left Sing Sing yesterday afternoon.\n6",

Upon\nlooking into the wagon they were horror struck at the\ntc\nappalling spectacle which presented itself to their\nview.\nThe father and nine children were lying dead in\nthe bottom of the wagon; the mother, probably the\nb\nlast survivor, was sitting up and holding the reins as r\nif driving:\nfi\nWe did not learn the name of this unfortunate fam-\nily, or from what part of the country they were re-\nmoving.\nto\nfa\nDeath by Freezing --The Gre ld (Mass ) Cou-\nlc\nrier states that Mr. John Barber, Jr. of Heath, 46\nyears of age, was found in the woods near that place,\nTE\non Satard\u0131y, the 25th utt. lying on his back in a state\nof insensibility, his feet and ancles frozen solid He\nhad lain in that condition forty hours, having been\novertaken by the storm of Thursday.

To exhibit it in all its windings\nand multiform shapes would require a more ingenious\npen\nthan\nmy own.\nIt accommodates itself to times,\nto places, and to circumstances. Cloaking itself un-\nder religious sanctity, it exclusively assumes the phi-\nlosopher, the sage, the patriot, and the philanthropist.\nIt claims to have done all the good; and whatever has\nbeen done by others it condemns as iniquitous, how-\never right itself, or with whatever motives it may\nhave been done. Whoever shall dare to question the\nsoundness of its creed, or think for himself in matters\nof religion, is denounced as a heretic; and whoever\nshall presume to do an act of piety or benevolence\nwithout its consent, is condemned as a profane infidel.\nIt seizes upon every act of Providence, and manifesta-\ntion of divine mercy and grace, and applies it to its own\nemolument.

Raymond, of Indiana, to the Legislature of the\nthat State.\nsh\nIn common with our constituents, we have abun-\ndant reason to be thankful to the Creator for the un-\nex\nprecedented amount of health we have enjoyed as a\npeople, for the last year\u2014for the great abundance\nof the fruits of the earth which have resulted from\nto\nthe cultivation of our soil and that as a nation we\nhave preserved both our identity and freedom, not-\nhi:\nwithstanding the many disorganizing elements which\nfo\nhave been and still are operating against us, both\nmorally and politically. Upou the one hand we have\nof\nTranscendentalism, Mormonisin, Millerism, and a\nth\nhost of similar isms, each claiming to be of divine\norigin, and the advocates each claiming of us in-\nplicit belief in these new and funciful theories in re-\nse\nligion and morals. On the other hand we have all\nbe\nthe ultraist of all the political parties to contend\nye\nwith--Whigism, Locofocoism, Tylerism and Aboli-\ntionism. Yet, amid all this elemental strife, we have\nle\nbeen able, through the patriotism and intelligence\nof our people, to preserve with little alteration the\npc\ninstitutions of the country, as they were handed\nbo\ndown to us by the fathers of the revolution. How\nmuch longer the people of Indiana, and the people\nth\nof the several States of the Union, shall be in pos-\nfe\nsession of the immense benefits which a properly\nconstituted and properly administered republican CC\ngovernment bestows, is for you, and the other legis-\nlative bodies of the Union, to decide.\nAs the subject of slavery, and the abolition of sla-\nvery, are now exciting so much interest throughout\nthis wide spread land, it may not be improper in me\nto bring the subject to your notice. Slavery has E\nbeen recognized as just in principle, both by the\npractises and laws of almost every nation under\ne\nheaven, from the earliest periods of the world, down\nst\nto the present time. The most barbarous, and the\nb\nmost enlightened and christian nations stand upon tr\nan equality in relation to this foul stain upon huoran-\nity. There is as much or more justice in the divine\ntl\nright claimed for kings to rule, than there is in the\nsubjugation of weaker nations and people for the\nM\npurpose of exacting from them involuntary servitude.\nti\nThe power to kidnap the poor African, and carry\nhim far from the home of his fathers-to lands, by\nhim unheard of and unknown, for the purpose of\nforcing upon him a life of slavery and degradation,\ndoes not carry with it any shadow of right or\njustice.\nThat right which power gives is the only justifi-ic\ncation which we have for a continuation of the slave\ntrade, either between Africa and America, or be-\ntween the several States of the Union. It is suffi-\nciently degrading to be a slave \"per se, without al-\nlowing to the master the power of separating fami-\nG\nlies and destroying those domestic relations which\ntl\nare as highly appreciated by the black man, as by\ntl\nthe white. Though all agree that slavery is wrong\nV\nin principle, it has became a question whether a\nF\ngreater amount of evil would not grow out of the\nsudden emancipation of all the slaves in the nation,\nthan to suffer them to remain in their present condi-\nto\ntion. This is a question, however, belonging more\nproperly to the slaveholders and the slaveholding\nStates to decide than to you. There can be no\ndoubt that a slave is as much the property of his\nmaster as any other chattel whatever, and that there\nis no power known to the Constitution and laws\nwhich can divest him of that right without his own\nI\nconsent. Under this view of the question, Congress\nhas no right te abolish slavery in the District of\nColumbia-neither the State Legislatures any more\npower to divest an individual of his right of proper-\nty in his slaves than of any other article which he\nmay own.\nBut the main question involved in the\ndiscussions growing out of slavery, is the right to\npetition Congress to abolish slavery in the District\nof Columbia, and to prevent the slave trade between i\nthe several States. It would seem that in a repub- a\nlican government where all men are declared to be\nborn free and equal, and where the representative is H\nconsidered to be simply an agent--that the people\nshould at any time not only have the right to peti-\ntion the government, but to demand as a right what-\never they should think fit to ask. The Constitution,\nhowever, has only guarantied to the citizen the priva\nilege of petitioning for the 'redress of grievances'-\nand unless it can be made to appear that slavery in\nthe States and within the District is a grievance to\nthe petitioners within the meaning ofthe Constitution,\nCongress will be justifiable in refusing to receive\nany petition upon that subject.\nI ain of the opinion that as a matter of expediency,\nCongress should receive all respectful petitions, and\nrefer them to appropriate committees. That there is\nnothing in the Constitution requiring the acceptance\nof all petitions, I grant; but as such a course is not\nprohibited, and as it is in accordance with the spirit\nand genius of republican institutions, it would seem\nthe wiser course to do so.\nBe the evils of slavery what they may-and all\nagree that they are enormous-it is much to be fear-\ned that the course taken by those who advocate its\nimmediate abolition is likely to produce, ultimately,\nfar greater. It is a subject which seems to arouse\nup all the fiercer passions of the human heart, and\nwhich buries beneath the ruins and confusion of\nthese conflicting emotions, all the finer and better\nfeelings of our nature. It is therefore a question\nburthened with unnumbered and unknown evils to\nthis country and unless the fierce spirit which\nactuates those interested in the controversy be al-\nlayed by reason and calm reflection, may lead to one\nof the most dire calamities which could possibly bc-\nfall us-a dissolution of the Union !\nI have said thus much upon the subject of slavery,\nnot with the view of having you discuss the merits\nof that question, but the question of the right of pe-\ntition, which has been blended with and made a part\nof it for the last five or six years.\n[ The following paragraphs, on capital punish-\nment, are from the same dignified, enlightened and\nhumane message:\nThe punishment of death for the crime of murder,\nwhich has received the sanction of all governments\nfrom the earliest history of man to the present time,\nhas become a fruitful source of argumentation and\ncontention among the citizens of most of the States\nof the confederacy. No individual can contemplate\nimprisonment for life with half the horror and fear\nthat he would the gallows, for there is no prison so\nstrong as to preclude all possibility of escape--and\nwhilst the possibility exists, there is room for hope,\nand where hope and expectation of escaping punish-\nment exists, you must look for the frequent repetition\nof the awful crime of murder which is now so rare\namongst us.\nShould this subject be brought to your considera-\ntion, I earnestly request you to reflect seriously upon\nthe consequences which may result to society by\nabolishing capital punishment\nIt is possible that the number of murders would\nnot be multiplied by changing the punishment of\ndeath for perpetual imprisonment\u2014but as no people\n50 far as my knowledge extends has done so, it will\nbe an experiment--and an experiment of fearful re-\nsponsibility to those who make the change.\nC",

                    "ocr_text": "The Day Fixed !\nThe last number of the Signs of the Times' con-\ntains an editorial article, in which it is assumed that\nthe very day of the end of the world, and of the Sec-\nond Coming of Christ, may be known, and in which\nthe 23d of May is designated as that day! After a\nseries of calculations, the writer says:\nAs the crucifixion was April 3d, A. D. 33, and the\n70 weeks seem to have terminated within 50 days\nafter, then the 2300 days which extend to the coming\nof Christ, 1810 years from the 70 weeks, seem to\nterminate by the 23d of May, 1843, by which time the\nrighteous have reason to expect to meet their Lord in\nair. The 7 days before the day of Pentecost, when\nour Saviour ascended to heaven, corresponds with\nthe seven days before the flood, when Noah was told\nthe very day of that event; and also with the half\nhour in Rev. viii. 1, when there was silence in heav-\nen on the opening of the seventh and last seal. If\nit should prove that the 70 weeks terminated with\nthe ascension of our Lord, when his ministry on earth\nceased, then the 2300 days would expire the middle\nof May, so that on the anniversary of the ascension\nof our Lord, the saints may ascend to meet him\nin the air, and then the seven days to the day of\nPentecost, corresponding with the seven days before\nthe flood, and the half hour of silence in Revelation,\nwould be a time of awful suspense to the wicked,\ntill the Pentecostal day, when instead of the Holy\nSpirit being poured out, would be poured out the\nvials of God's wrati.\nWhen it is said in Rev. i. 7, that every eye shall\nsee hiin, they also which pierced him'are included;\nand as they will not see him till the last resurrection,\nit may be that the wicked will only know that Christ\nhas come from the fact that the righteous and all\nthe little babes are gone. When Daniel saw the\nSaviour, his comeliness was turned into corruption,\nand he retained no strength ; also when John saw\nhim, he fell at his feet as dead.' It may therefore\nbe that men will be unable to behold the Saviour\nwhile in this mortal state, and that the righteous may\nnot see him till they are changed, for the sight of\nhim might strike all the wicked dead. If those who\n5 are not changed can see him, they would know the\nhour when he comes, but it is said, Rev. iii. 3. If\ntherefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee\nas a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will\ncome upon thee. It may therefore be that those\nonly will be changed who are found watching. -\nHence the injunction. Luke xxi. 34-36. And\ntake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts\nbe overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness,\nand cares of this life, and so that day come upon you\nunawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them\nthat dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch\nye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be ac-\ncounted worthy to escape all these things that shall\ncome to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\nHow important it is then, that we should be con-\ntinually watching; for as a snare will it come on all\nthat dwell on the earth, or regard this as their home;\nbut the righteous are strangers and pilgrims here\nbelow, looking for a city to come.\nOur opposers all have their eye on the 23d of\nApril; why, no one knows; for none of the Ad-\nvent believers have ever thought of that day. They\nhave had their eye more on the 15th of February,\nand the 3d of April--on the latter, because of the\ncrucifixion of our Lord, when many supposed the\n70 weeks expired; and on the former, because then\nthe Pope was dethroned, which was supposed to be\nthe end of the 1290 days. There is, however, no\nnecessary connection between the 1290 days and the\n1260 ; only that both terminate the same year. It\nhowever does not follow that they terminated at the\nsame point in the year. But it seems to be neces-\nsary that the scoffers should have a time to rejoice,\nand the faith of the believers be tried. Such will\nbe the case if the 23d of April shall pass by. Then,\nhigh in air they will toss their ready cap, and feel\nthat they can breathe freer: and then will they be-\ngin to scoff in earnest. Then will also be fulfilled\nwhat is spoken by the prophet Ezekiel, xii. 21, 22:\n. And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,\nSon of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the\nland of Israel, saying, 'THE DAYS ARE PROLONGED,\nAND EVERY VISION FAILETH?' They begin to say\nit now, and then they will shout it aloud. 230, 25th\nverses: \"Tell them, therefore, Thus saith the Lord\nGod; I will make this proverb to cease, and they\nshall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but say\nunto them, \"The days are at hand, and the EFFECT OF\nEVERY VISION. For there shall be no more any\nvision nor flattering divinition within the house of\nIsrael. For I am the Lord : I will speak, and the\nword that I shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall\nbe no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious\nhouse, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith\nthe Lord God.'\nWhen the effect of EVERY Vision has been seen,\nprobation will be no longer delayed; and this is to\nbe when they say that every vision faileth ; and the\nvision may seem to man to tarry.\n26-28 verses: 'Again the word of the Lord came\nto me, saying, Son of man, behold, they of the house\nof Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for MANY\nDAYS TO COME, and he prophesieth of the TIMES THAT\nARE AFAR OFF. Therefore say unto them, Thus\nsaith the Lord God; There shall NONE OF MY WORDS\nBE PROLONGED ANY MORE, but the word which I\nhave spoken shall be DONE, saith the Lord God.'\nThey are already using this proverb, but they\nwill also use it to perfection if the 23d of April shall\npass away. They may therefore have one short\nmonth to rejoice over a supposed failure of the time\n--the same as Belshazzar, according to the tradition\nof the Jews, had supposed that the 70 years predict-\ned by Jeremiah were fulfilled, at the end of which\nthe king of Babylon was to be punished and that\nnation.\nBut the king, according to this tradition, had him-\nself computed the time, and thinking the seventy\nyears were fully expired, and that the prediction had\nfailed, made a great feast to a thousand of his lords\nto rejoice over the supposed failure of the prophecy;\nand in the midst of the feast, while they were mak-\ning merry, and praising the gods of silver and gold,\nthe fingers of the hand were seen writing on the\nwall, filling their hearts with consternation; and in\nthat night those seventy years expired. Belshazzar\nthe king of the Chaldeans was slain, and Darius the\nMedian took the kingdom. Even so may the ene-\nmies of Christ have an opportunitv to rejoice over\na supposed failure of the prophetic periods. We are,\nhowever, told that 'the triumphing of the wicked will\nbe SHORT;' and to the righteous God says, Isa. xxvi.\n20, 21. \"Come, my people, enter thou into thy\nchambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thy-\nself as it were for a little moment, until the indig-\nnation be overpast. For behold the Lord cometh\nout of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth\nfor their iniquity : the earth also shall disclose her\nblood, and shall no more cover her slain.' They\nmay rejoice for a little moment, but soon the Lord\nwill come to deliver his own; for a short work will\nthe Lord make upon the earth, and he will cut it\nshort in righteousness.\nThe 2300 days therefore seem to terminate by the\n23d of May; so let us now look for the blessed hope\nof the glorious appearing of the great God and our\nSaviour Jesus Christ.\n6",

The course of\nel\nevents is rapidly bringing out the proofs on this\nfr\nsubject. All that the Virginia and Kentucky slave-\nholders may profess, of their opposition to the slave-\ntrade, amounts to nothing, as a refutation of the ac-\ntl\ncumulative proofs that in their support of slavery,\nthey sympathize entirely with the barracoon-keep-\ners of Cuba and Brazil. Mr. Wise's nomination as\nMinister to France, at this eventful crisis, shows c\nthat interests are involved, in our present diplomatic ,\nconcerns at Paris, which may not be entrusted to tl\nany northern man. Why will not northern states-\nmen show a little common sense in investigating the o\nreal causes of political events ?\nThe various developments that are brought for- o\nward will, by and by, compel attention.\nindebted to an intelligent friend in New-York, to si\nwhom the French language is vernacular, for the is\ncommunication of a piece of information which y\nthrows a blaze of light upon every thing pertaining th\nto American diplomacy at Paris--the movements of se\nGeneral Cass; the publications of the Rev. Dr. Baird, to\nthe letters of Robert Walsh, the baflling course of th\nthe French abolitionists, the writings of Henry\nWheaton, the German periodicals, the refusal of th\nFrance to ratify her own treaties--are all part of one ta\nsystem of operations, the object of which is here\ndisclosed. The plan is arranged, and it has bither-\nto been kept from Anglo Saxon eyes by being cir-\nculated in the French language. Let us draw aside\nthe veil.\nThe Courier des Etats Unis is a weekly French\nnewspaper, published in the city of New-York, con-\nducted with ability and diligence, and is the vehicle\nof information on American events to continental\nEurope. Our friend sends us a copy of the paper,\nS\nof date February 16, 1843, containing an article\nwhich he has also had the goodness to translate, and\nwhich we now present to our readers, as a most im-\nportant communication at the present moment:\nFrom the Courier des Etats Unis, New-York, Februaryt\n16th.\nSome months ago, whilst calling attention to the\nincreasing fanaticism of the abolitionists in the old a\nand new world, and to the danger which results to\nthe interests of the Spanish, French and American\nplanters, we pointed out to these last, the utility, the\npressing necessity of a common alliance as the only\nefficacious means of turning aside the common dan-\nger. This hint has produced quite a sensation in\nthe southern States of this Union, and in the Span-\nish islands. A correspondence which we have re-\nceived from Martinique, informs us, that there also\nit has found a prodigious echo. One of the most\ndistinguished members of the Colonial Council, and\na most devoted defender of the rights of the Colon-\nists, Mr. Cicero, has immediately called the atten-\ntion of his countrymen to our proposition in the fol-\nlowing article, published by bin; and of which he\nsends us a copy. Here it is :\n\"Saint PierrE, MARTINIQUE, Jan. 6, 1843.\nThe numbers of the 17th and 27th September of\nthe Courier des Etats Unis, entertain the readers of\nthat journal with the idea of an alliance between\nthe French colonies, the Spanish islands, and the\nUnited States of America. The reasons for this al-\nliance are developed with as much logic as spirit.\nOf all the European powers, there remains but\none which has still delayed-hesitated to associate\nitself with the revolutionary projects that England\nnourishes, avows and executes against those com-\nmunities where slavery exists regularly and legally.\nPrussia, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Naples, Sar-\ndinia, Sweden, Holland and Russia herself, that\ncountry of white slaves, have given their adhesion\nto the principles of the right of visit, and the war of\nextermination which England has made a political\naxiom against the countries where grow productions\nsimilar to those of India. France is the only dike\nProvidence has thrown across the torrent Protected\nby her resistance, Spain and Brazil can still defend\n--the one, her islands of Cuba and Porto Rico-the\nother, her own shores, against British oppression. But\nthe day France surrenders, all will have to surrender\nwith her; the day abolitionism shall have obtained, in\nthe French Chambers, the emancipation of the blacks\nof Martinique, of Guadaloupe and of Marie Galante,\nthe proprietors of Cuba, Porto Rico and Brazil, must\nhasten to free theirs, lest they call down storm and\ndeath on their own heads.\nHow, indeed, could the two Spanish islands hope\nto resist long, isolated as they would be in the cen-\ntre of a circle of foes ? Alone in the midst of a\nworld conspired against them? Madrid can only re-\nsist London, by leaning on Paris, and the instant\nthis prop comes to fail her, she will have to submit.\nThis is inevitable.\nThe blacks of the French and Spanish islands\nonce free, what will be the position of the United\nStates? They have afar, Europe coalesced against\nthem; and this Europe, monarchical, inimical to\ntheir republican institutions, has her advanced posts\non their very frontier--Cuba, Porto Rico, complete\nwith the Bahama, Jamaica and St. Domingo islands,\nan effective abolitionist blockade against the Union.\nIn time of peace, this blockade preaches desertion,\nand offers a secure and neighboring asylum to run-\naways; in war, it foments, revolts and provides chiefs\nand arms to the rebels. In the first case, it holds\nout the hand; in the last, a torch and dagger.\nNever anything more correct and true, was said\nin politics. The alliance preached by the American\nJournal is a mutual insurance, of which the French\ncolonies, Brazil, the Spanish islands, and the Uuited\nStates, should hasten to realize the fruitful idea.\nThere is no time to be wasted in the false calcu-\nlations of a prudence that is out of season. France\nis hesitating, and may give way, from one moment to\nanother. She is in a position, where, pushed on one\nside by abolition delusions, the defence would leave\nher without a shelter on the contrary side. No doubt,\nshe is intelligent, brave and firm of herself, this\nsame France; but she is weak through her states-\nmen, and it is there, above all, that England is strong\n, Nothing to oppose to the John Russells, Broughams,\n; Stanleys, and to M. Guizot-but the press, the intel-\n- lligent, patriotic, powerful press of France.\n3 FREEDOM SE\nITIM\n2012\nANITA\n8 LAVES\nHORSES &\nOTHER.CAT\nTLE FOR SALE",

It is a grave question\nfo\nhow far morality would be the gainer, were the plan\nadopted in this country, where laws are so often\nenacted upon the overthrow of just principle, to\ngratify the prejudices of the populace, or to advance in\nthe interests of a party\u2014but the suggestion is a\nth\ngood one for the promulgation of the new doctrines\nfrom time to time established in the Church, the\nnew rules of faith and practice adopted by our Ec-\nclesiastical Assemblies and Church organs, which\nevery clergyman might expound from the pulpit to\nhis people.

However acceptable may be this course to\nthe Churchmen generally, we are well aware that t\nsome will read this paper with displeasure, and oth-\ners with indifference, either real or affected, and in\nadvance we advise those who wish to escape all\nt.\nconnection with matters of questionable popularity,\nto follow the example of the ancient sceptics, and\nwhen asked their opinion of its truth, to reply in the P\nlanguage of their worthy prototype--I refrain from\njudging, I define nothing. *\nIn the month of June, 1839, the Board of Trus-\ntees of the General Theological Seminary, com-\nposed of the bishops, and clerical and lay delegates\nfrom the different States and territories, met at New-\nYork, and their proceedings were subsequently pub-\nlished in a pamphlet. From the minutes, it appears\nthat a candidate for holy orders, in the diocese of\nNew-York, applied to them by petition, to be allow-\ned to enter the seminary as a student\u2014that the pe-\ntition was referred to a committee, consisting of the\nRight Rev. Bp. H. U. Onderdonk, Drs. James Mil-\nnor, and Hugh Smith, and Esquires Wm. Johnson,\nDavid B. Ogden, and Edward A. Newton-who,\nafter deliberate consideration, recompiended a resu-\nlution of rejection, which was adopted ; that the\nRight Rev. Bp. Doane asked leave to enter his pro-\ntest against this decision, and that leave was not\ngranted. Neither the reasons for the decision, nor\na the disqualification of the candidate, are even inti-\nmated by the minutes; but it does appear, that the\ntright of every candidate for orders to enter the sem-\ninary was expressly guarantied by the constitution,\nwhich the trustees were bound to obey, and that this\nfact was well known to them from an amendment\nproposed by the Bishop of New York, while the\nt matter was pending, to the very clause upon which\nthey were trampling.\nThe true cause which led the trustees to nullify\ne the constitution and deny the right of the candidate,\nand which they were ashamed to acknowledge, was,\n1. that he was a colored man; and this was the only\n, cause, since his diocesan, Bishop Onderdonk of N.\n-York, has declared in the Churchman, (Nov. 4, 1839)\ns that he explicitly stated to them, that if they should\ns think it right and proper to admit a colored man\ninto the seminary, he considered the applicant be-\nd\nfore the one in whose case it might with great safety\nn and propriety be done.?\nh\nNothing can be clearer than that the trustees, by\nthat act, not only exceeded their powers and violated\nthe trust rep\u00f2sed in them, but deliberately estab-\n- | lished a system of CASTE in the church-not among\ne its lower members only-not among the laity alone,\no but among the very clergy, who approach us as\ne the ambassadors of God, and minister at his altars--\ne caste as palpable as that which separates, in heathen\nt, India, the Brahmin from the Sooda. They estab-\ns lished a principle which would justify us in regard-\ning the colored man as an inferior being, intended\nto occupy a lower sphere in the scale of creation;\ns,\n1- * Quoted by Sextus Empiricus in his Pyrronian Hy-\npoty posee.\nU\n5\ns\n3- EMANCIPATION\nBERA1",

It is from these sources alone that ex\ngenuine respect and authority can be derived, and an\nan endeavor to make these appendages to office in-pu\ndependent of the personal character and conduct of of\nthe judge is an attempt which, in this free and en- peff\nlightened country, probably never will succeed. ne\nThe freedom of inquiry is not only essential to the we\nintegrity of the community, but every judge, con- to\nscious of integrity, and acting honorably, ought to co\npromote, and rejoice in the exercise of its\ntal\nIf there is truth in these remarks as regards the sit\njudges, they are equally applicable to the trustees cit\nof the seminary, and we have been led to think froin me\ntheir conduct, that they have forgotten in what age wh\nthey live an age,' when, in the words of Webster, de\nneither nations nor individuals can divest them- fe\nselves of responsibility before the world. Our cler-ag\nical bodies of all denominations will do well to re- gy\nmember that they are acting before the eyes of co\nmen, and that the sanctity of their professions, so ar\nfar from inducing in the people a belief of their in- so\nfallibility, only exposes them to a stricter scrutiny;\nthat every act of clerical inconsistency, every on\ncrouching to an unholy prejudice, will be apt to re-wl\nflect their own dishonor upon the Church at large. In\nLeast of all will the honest Christian be disposed to qu\ntake all things for granted. He well knows from of\nhistory, that murder may be committed on the an\nBench, and spiritual oppression may be sheltered by to\nthe mitre; and he feels that although the ermine orth\nthe lawn may palliate the act in the eyes of the of\nworld, it would be blasphemy to suppose it lessens ce\nits guilt in Heaven's Chancery above. He must be it\nignorant indeed who supposes the clergy, as a body, ha\nto be exempt from ambition and the love of power. ur\nHuman nature is not put off when the clerical robe an\nis put on; but as face answereth to face in a glass, th\nso answereth the heart of man to man.\nLet not our clergy fear that the Church will do\nsuffer from too close an examination of any doc-Y\ntrine they may propound. Veritas nihil veretur nisi et\nabscondi-truth fears nothing but concealment. If co\nthe doctrine is wrong, it should be discarded; if sh\ntrue, its claims should be enforced; and we have the a\npromise of scripture, he that hath clean bands shall ve\ngrow stronger and stronger. No worse plan can be bu\nadopted to secure peace than to attempt to stifle w\ninstead of to convince. \"To enjoin silence, re- m\nmarks Mr. Newman,' upon perplexed inquiries, is be\nnot to silence their thoughts, which in the case of P\nserious minds naturally turn to the spiritual ruler w\nfor advice and relief, and are disappointed at the ti- of\nmidity, or intimidated at the harshness of those who re\nrefuse to lead a lawful inquiry which they cannot sti- m\nse't\nIn relation to the right of laymen to examine for P\nthemselves,the doctrines propounded by the clergy, if\nthere are any who entertain the slightest doubt, they re\nmay be satisfied by the following authority from a fr\nsource, whence lax opinions of the powers of bish-\nops are not likely to come. 'It has always been agree-w\nable to the principles of the church, that, if a bishop -\ntaught and upheld what was contrary to the orthodox w\nfaith, the clergy and people were not bound to sub-\nmit, but were obliged to maintain the true religion, tl\nand if excommunicated by such bishops, they were to\nnot accounted to be cut off from the church. As re\nfor the cry of peace, we have the experience of s\nages to teach us that peace may be purchased at too j\ndear a price. In the language of Dr. Hook, too\nwhich all must subscribe, Every christian man, s\nwhether laic or cleric, is in duty bound to consider,\nnot what is expedient at the moment for the sake of\npeace, BUT WHAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE CAUSE I\nor TRUTH. And according to these just views, p\nthere is no reason why we should not scrutinize as\nclearly, and attack as vigorously, prejudice against\ncolor, when it enters the Church of God, robed in c\nthe vestments of the priesthood, and armed with ec-p\nclesiastical authority, as when it heads a lawless\ngang of shirtless ruffians, or is applauded in the stu-\npid huzzas of a worthless rabble.\nFor our own part, we have no hesitation in ex-a\npressing our conviction, that there is more reason in s\nhanging for forgery and burning for heresy, than in s\npersecuting a man on account of the skin given him\nby God. We scarcely suppose that the merit of an-\ntiquity will be claimed for caste, founded on color,\nwhile Cyprian, Tertullian and Augustine are named\nwith reverence; and however excellent may be\nf thought the rule of Vincentius Lirinensis: 'Quod\nubique, quod semper, quod abomnibus creditum, est,\n&c. it was never so believed of caste. It is a new\nprinciple, a new doctrine, a new order in the Church,\nand one which, judging from appearances, is, with-\nout a vigorous opposition, likely to continue. The\n,\nexample set by the Trustees in oppressing a man for\nthe color of his skin, has been widely followed. In\nNew-York, a respectable citizen has been rudely\nejected from a railroad car; even as the candidate\net\nfor holy orders was by them refused admittance to\nthe seminary. In this State, the colored population\nor\n1 -\nare deprived of the right of suffrage, unless the dis-\ne qualifying tint is removed by a property qualification.\nIn Philadelphia, they have been again and again ex-\nposed to the fury of cruel mobs-their houses have\nbeen plundered and burnt, and their families and\nat\ntheir little ones driven forth to meet unsheltered the\nstorm and the tempest, have sought in flight that\nh protection which the municipal authorities did not\nconceive themselves bound to render the wretches\n\u0413\u0443\nguilty of a colored skin, their sympathies being\nrather with the human wolves whom the hunted\nfugitives were seeking to escape.\ns,\nIn the capital of our country, free colored men\nare liable to arrest on suspicion of being fugitive\nslaves. If unable to prove their freedom, they are\n\u00e0 sold as slaves, and if, after being incarcerated for\nweeks within the damp and gloomy walls of a prison;\n2-\nthey succeed in obtaining the evidence of their\nEy\nfreedom, they are still liable to be sold as slaves for\nlife, if they are too poor to pay the jail-fees. In Al-\ny\nabama, a more summary law has been enacted, by\ned\nwhich any free man of color coming into the State\nafter its passage, may be seized, and held as a slave\nfor life, by the first white man who catches him--and\ne,\nin Florida, a law obtains which puts to the blush the\ntale of Shylock and his single pound of flesh. Free\ncolored debtors may be sold as slaves, to satisfy the\nclaim of any white creditor.\nIn the Church also, the example of the trustees\nd.\nis strictly followed.

                    "ocr_text": "Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce.\nLONDON, March 3d.\nLor\u016f Howick's important motion, for a committee\nof the House of Commons to inquire into the distress\nof the country, after a tedious debate of five night's\nduration, was lost by 306 to 191--thus giving min-\nisters the large majority of 115. The conclusion of\nthe debate was marked by most extraordinary pro-\nceedings. Mr. Cobden, the eminent leader and ora-\ntor of the Anti-Corn Law League, delivered a pow-\nerful and argumentative speech, the effect of which\nin the House was immense and electrical. In the\ncourse of it, and particularly in the peroration, he\nimpressively painted out the awful condition of the\ncountry, and the personal responsibility of the min-\nister, by virtue of his office, in refusing all inquiry,\nand declining to bring forward any measure, whose\nobject should be the relief of the pending distress.\nAs soon as this gentleman sat down, Sir Robert Peel\njumped up, threw back his coat off his chest, with\nboth hands, then violently struck the right one on\nthe Secretary of State's box, and exclaimed, 'Sir.'\nNo sooner had this word left his lips, then back fled\nthe fronts of his coat again fiercely over his shoul-\nders, and down went his left hand on the box with\nincreased passion, accompanied by furious oscilla-\ntions of the body, and with a countenance fraught\nwith fury, wrath, and heavily suppressed horror. At\nlast he said, in tones of sweltering sarcasm, The\nhonorable gentleman has said here, what he has of-\nten stated to the League, that he holds me, (and\nhere Sir Robert's voice was instantly changed, and\nbecame most serious, solemn and syllabic,) me, per-\nson-al-ly-here the ministerial party took up the\nidea that Cobden wanted to point out the Premier\nfor assassination, and well did they support their\nleader, for up rose a yell as loud, fearful and long-\ncontinuous, as ever was heard in that House,) me\nin-di-vid-ually responsible '-resumed the baronet,\nand again the yells, hootings, revilings, execrations,\nand denunciatory phrases, went forth with a fiend-\nlike demonianism perfectly appalling. Mr. Cobden\n.\ngot up, and attempted to explain, but it was of no\nuse; the monopolist majority would have its way, and\n,\nit was only after the most trying difficulties had been\nsurmounted, that the Anti-Corn Law League leader\nwas allowed to say a word.\nNow, the whole of this, I am sorry to say, was a\npiece of the most consummate acting ever beheld.\nSir Robert Peel attempted to crush a political oppo-\nnent by fixing upon him a foul and monstrous crime,\nby making believe that the previous declarations of\nMr. Cobden had led to the murder of Mr. Drum-\nmond, and that his denunciations of that morning-\nit took place at dawn of day-were vile incentives\nto positive assassination. After this scene, so utter-\nly destructive of character to Sir Robert Peel, never\nagain let us hear the British declaring that in the\nUnited States alone it can be found that the honor\nof public men is ruthlessly sacrificed for the pur-\npose of getting up a little political capital.' In-\nstead of being damaged, Cobden is now cheered\nand cherished wherever he goes; and addresses are\nbeing sent to him from all parts of the country. It\nwas a mistakesan awful inistake--on the part of\nSir Robert Peel Cobden is not to be put down but\nby force of reason and sound argument. He pos-\nsesses nerve, and has the support of millions.\nFrom the Boston Christian World.\nAn International Daily Journal.\nThis singular project deserves more notice than\nit is likely to receive. American, English and\nFrench papers could not do humanity a greater ser-\nvice than to link themselves together in support of\nthis noble object. A daily journal is to be published\nin French at Paris, under the care of three directors\nof the three different nations, France, England and\nAmerica. His Excellency, H. Wheaton, and Dr.\nBowring, together with one of the most distinguish-\ned statesmen of France, are to be its responsible\nheads. The paper is to be cominenced as soon as the necessary shares of one thousand francs each\nare subscribed.\nIts first purpose is announced to be the promotion\nof peace and international philanthropy : its second,\nthat of fostering amicable relations between these\ndifferent countries: the third, that of advancing the\ninterests of England and America in Europe, and of\nFrance everywhere.\nIt is believed that the enterprise will prove pro-\nductive ; several of the newspapers of Paris now\nproducing immense incomes; yet those who engage\nin it as managers, desire no other reward but that of\ndoing good. Besides refuting the many misrepre-\nsentations, and rectifying the mistakes continually\nmade as to American manners, customs, institutions,\n&c., they intend to unite, as far as their influence\nextends, these three standard-bearers of civilization\nin every wise, benevolent and holy work--to do eve-\nry thing in their power to avert the dread calamity\nof war, which, in the present state of public credit,\nthe widely extended relations of commerce, the vast\nexpenditure occasioned by military operations in the\npresent improved state of military science, involving\nthe necessity of contracting new debts, or crushing\nthe people with taxation, would render such a ca-\nlamity as war between France and England, or\nEngland and America, immeasurably greater than\nany history records.' So says Mr. Wheaton, and we\nsay, Amen.\nF.",

These gentlemen have been niz\nblamed for not submitting cheerfully to such cruel Nc\ntreatment, and in the case of the first, his very peti- the\ntion to the trustees was considered by the bishop a\nthe\nviolation of his duty as a candidate for orders. If\nWe know not how far canonical obedience in such Ch\nmatters extends, but we do know that there is a high its\nduty now resting upon the colored people, both in of\nand out of the Church, to maintain their rights; and ly\nif a candidate feels, as justly he may feel, that en- tou\ntrance to the seminary is not a boon to be asked, but wh\na right to be demanded, we wonder not that the his\nspirit of a man should be aroused within at th\nunconstitutional vote of rejection, like that which des\nswelled the breast of Paul, when he cowed not be-\nfore his accusers unmindful of his civil privileges, to\nbut with conscious dignity exclaimed, 'I am a Ro-\nthe\nman citizen !!\naffe\nThe Rev. Peter Williams, for many years a respec- it\ntable clergyman of this State, was never allowed to fat\nsit as a member of the Convention, nor has the tit\nChurch of St. Philip, of which he was the pastor,\nHe\nbeen yet represented in that body. He died soon\nafter the act of the trustees, upon which we have is\nbeen remarking, was exposed to the world; and to tio\ncounteract, as far as possible, the indignation it had yo\nexcited, the clergy in a body attended his funeral, to\nand the Bishop of New-York pronounced from the titz\npulpit a high eulogium upon his character. Several I\nof the clergy admitted that it was done merely for wa\neffect, and one of them bitterly remarked at the fu- Tr\nneral, that the empty honors of the lifeless dust sio\nwere a poor atonement for the insults so often offered\nto the living man. The Rev. Mr. De Grasse, another low\ncolored clergyman of the Episcopal church, of fine be\ntalents, excellent acquirements, and amiable dispo- Re\nsition, who, after a residence of some years in this\nof\ncity, sought in the West Indies the respectful treat-\nment and sympathy he could not find at home, and\nwho there ended his early years by a Christian's\ndeath, once said to us, with tears in his eyes,\nI da\nfeel that the bishop and many of the clergy are\nagainst us--that they do not want any colored cler- off\ngymen in the church. I have struggled against the wa\nconviction, but it is impossible to resist it; the proofs of\nare too strong; I experience it daily, I know it is bro\nso.\ned\nAy! this aristocracy of color is maintained, not be\nonly in God's temples, but even in that last abode pe\nwhere all distictions have been supposed to disappear. te\nIn the very grave-yard, where death reigns as con-\nqueror, and worms revel on the mouldering remains\nof manliness and beauty; where pride, and pomp,\nthe\nand power have doffed their trappings, and have said ho\nto corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, th\nthou art my mother and my sister; where the voice cle\nof passion is forever stilled, and the heart that has\nceased to beat is cold as the marble beneath which\nit reposes; even here, among the tombs, Prejudice br\nhas his dwelling like the demoniac of old, and Caste,\nunder the sanction of the Church, rears his hideous\nand revolting form. How many similar instances\n\u041d.\nthere may be, we know not; that we cite has come\nunder our immediate notice. The vestry and war-\ndens of an Episcopal church in the diocese of New-\nYork, a few years since, accepted a deed for a cem-\netery, which was demised to them upon the express\ncondition embodied in the indenture, that they fri\nshould never suffer any colored person to be buried in he\nany part of the same;' and all the subsequent con-\nveyances on the part of the church of vaults and\neburial places are subject to the same condition. It\nwas at the same time provided, that the Presbyterian th\nminister of the town, whoever he might be, might g\nbe interred therein without charge; but had the Rev.\nf Peter Williams died in the town, not all the clergy ar\nwho followed his hearse, nor the exalted eulogium ex\nof his bishop, could have obtained for his bones a th\nresting place in that aristocratic grave-yard. They m\n- might have been fated to remain within the borders\nof a sister parish, like the corse of the murdered ti:\nPolidore, unlamented, uninterred.\nIt matters little, to be sure, to our colored breth-\nren where their dust is laid, when the soul, escaped\nfrom its prison-house, has reached that happy land,\nwhere the wicked cease from troubling and the\nweary are at rest, and blest thought for the slave\n- the servant is freed from his master,' compared ti\nwith their treatment while denizens on earth; but (\nwe trust there will not be many grave yards, when di\n-, the earth and the sea shall give up their dead at the\ntrump of the arch-angel and the voice of God, whose de\ns reanimated spirits, clothed in their proper bodies, a\nfshall exbibit to the assembled universe before the\njudgment bar the spectacle of caste-an aristocracy If\no of color, untarnished by the presence of a single\n, soul that in this world had been guilty of the enor-\nr, mity of a black skin.\nfc\nWhat is the object of this systematic persecution ?\nE The persecutions of ancient times had at least a\ns, plausible pretext to support them. The statute er\n-s officio for instance, procured by the pliant Henry\net IV, at the request of the bishops, authorized and\nn commanded them to proceed against all persons sus-\n-pected of being tainted with heresy, and commit all\n\u0440\ns who are found guilty to prison, so long as to their \u0441\n1-diseretion should be thought expedient, and fine\nthem as they should think competent to the offence; t\nand in case they refuse to abjure and recant, the\nn said person, after the sentence had been pronounced,\nn should be burned in the sight of all the people, to\nm the intent that this kind of punishment might be a\n7-terror unto others.'\nr, Here was a definite object professed, to prevent\nEd other persons becoming heretics; but what was the\ne object of the trustees and their many coadjutors? t\nod Was it to frighten the blacks into pale faces, or to\ntz' induce them to beget white children? Surely they\nw might have remembered the question of old, Can\nh, the Ethiopian change his skin?' It is God who\nh-hath colored them, and who were the trustees to say\ne to their Maker, What doest thou, and why hast\nor thou made them thus ?' Pity it is that in that event-\nin ful hour when caste was formally established in the\nly Church, no voice had reminded them of the words,\nte But the Lord said unto Samuel, look not upon his\nto countenance, the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for\nonman looketh at the outward appearance, but the\nS- Lord looketh at the heart.**\nThe blacks, it is true, are a persecuted race, and\nx- because persecuted, to some extent degraded; and\nwe the Church, so far from affording them a shelter\nnd from the storm, becoming to them as rivers of water\nhe in a dry place, and the shadow of a great rock in a\nat weary land, giving them beauty for ashes, the oil of\ntot joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the\nes spirit of heaviness, joins herself to the army of their\nng oppressors. So far from opening her arms to receive\ned them, and appealing to them in the affectionate\ntones, Will ye also go away?' she scourges them\nen from the portals they fain would enter. Possibly\nve the dignitaries of the Church may imagine that the\nEre sanctity of their office lightens the b\u00fcrthen of their\nfor harsh treatment\u2014the experience of those on whom\non, it falls might tell a different tale. Charles II. of\neir Spain, in 1665, implored the Inquisition to indulge\nfor hiin with an Auto da fe, and when his request was\n11- granted, his royal hands supplied a faggot. \"The\nby sticks were gilt, adorned with flowers, and tied up\nte with ribbons, but we do not learn that these grace-\nve ful ornaments alleviated the anguish of the victims\nnd to his kingly malice.\nche One might imagine there were enough in the\nee present condition of our colored people to enlist the\nEhe sympathies rather than the prejudices of Christians.\nBut it seems to be the reverse, and the Episcopal\nees Church, as represented by the trustees of the semi-\nin nary, is now a precedent for every infringement of\ntheir rights, however unconstitutional, for every out-\nrage upon their character and feelings, however in-\nnry excusable. Such, however, is not the real char-\nOU\nal\nW\nut\nW\nal\n8\nry\na\na.\nSO\nn\ns\na\nS\nf\na\na\non.\n*1 Sam. 16, 17. AGENTS.\nMAINE.-A. Soule, Bath.\nNew-HAMPSHIRE.-N. P.

In the Church,\nthe claim of universel brotherhood is fully recog-\nnized, and he who denies it, is a traitor to her faith.\nNo word of her creed, no line in her articles, lends\nthe slightest sanction to any form of oppression-to\nthe slavery of the whip, or the slavery of prejudice:\nIf the voice of humanity speaks forcibly to other\nChristians, with what words of power does it address\nitself to churchmen-speaketh it not in every page\nof her noble liturgy-breatheth it not in her heaven-\nly teachings, her holy devotions, her solemn litany-\ntoucheth it not the heart of every true churchman,\nwhen Sunday by Sunday, in God's house, he unites\nhis petitions with those of the congregation, in com-\nmending to His fatherly goodness all those who are\ndestitute, or oppressed in mind, body or estate ; that it\nmay please him to comfort and relieve them, according\nto their several necessities, giving them patience under\ntheir sufferings, and an happy issue out of all theit\nafflictions ;' or when to the prayer of the priest, ' that\nit may please him to defend and provide for the\nfatherless children and widows, and all who are des-\ntitute and oppressed, the united response rises to\nHeaven, We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.?\nThat bishops should ever side with the oppressor,\nis strange indeed. To each one, at his consecra-\ntion, was put the solemn question, Will you sti\u00f3r\u00f3\nyourself gentle, and be merciful, for CHRIST's sake,\nto all poor and needy people, and to all strangers des-\ntitute of help?\" and from each has come the answer,\n\"I WILL SO Show myself, BY God's HELP. No\nwonder that Bishop Doane rose in the Board of\nTrustees to enter his protest against that cruel d\u00e9ci-\nsion. We know there are some, we trust there are\nmany, who are ready, on all fitting occasions, to fol-\nlow his example. Two instances we will mention,\nbecause so nearly connected with our subject. The\nReverend Mr. Burgess and the Reverend Mr. Coxe,\nof Hartford, have disregarded, and treated with con-\ntempt, the principle acted upon by the Board. The\nvery individual whose petition the trustees rejected;\nand whose name was stricken from the roll of candi-\ndates in this diocese, having been admitted to Dea-\ncon's orders by the late excellent Bishop Griswold,\nofficiated in the churches of both these gentlemen,\nwas received and treated by them, in the presence\nof large and fashionable congregations, as an equal\n= brother, and not a syllable of disapprobation disturb-\ned the harmony of the scene. Such is the contrast\nbetween christian consistency and a temporizing ex-\npediency; and we venture to believe that the trus-\ntees, although deeply vexed at the silent but stern\n- rebuke administered by these gentlemen, will ad-\nmire their boldness and independence. Soon may\nthe day come, when no person holding the high and\nholy office of the priesthood, shall be found among\nthe oppressors of the black man. Soon may our\n- clergy learn, that no opposition from without, no\ns malicious slanders, no infidel sneers can injure their\nreputation, character and influence, as much as one\n- broad, plain, undeniable inconsistency like this:\n3\n*Opening speech of the Ghost of Polidore in the\nHecuba of Euripides.",

The number of ves.\nsels belonging to Havana which in the year 1838 were\nengaged in the trade, amounted to 71 ; in 1839, to 59;\nin 1840, to 54; 1841, to 31 ; and in 1842, there were\nonly three vessels so engaged. The number of ne-\ngroes imported in 1839 was as many as 25,000 ; in\nin 1840, 14,470; in 1841, 11,857; and in 1842, only\n3150. The largest number imported was 28,000. At\nthe instance of the mixed commission, a very large\nproportion of those were emancipated. During the\nlast year, Gov. Valdez gave full freeeom to 1215 of\nthe negroes emancipated by the Mixed Court prior to\nthe treaty of 1835, and who, though nominally eman-\ncipated, bad been retained in a state of virtual slave-\nry. The Governor has, moreover, within the year,\nmade five seizures of bodies of newly imported Afri.\ncans, amounting in all to 754 ; so that these may be\ndeducted from the number of new slaves, leaving the\nactual number only 2396.\nWhole Family Poisoned.-We have not read of\na more dreadful calamity than that detailed by a re-\ncent number of the Grenada (Miss.) Register. This\npaper informs us of the whole family of Mr. Morehead,\nresiding near the Yazoo Pass, having been poisoned\nby eating peaches dried on a painted board. One of\nhis daughters was to have been married on the very\nday she was so suddenly taken from earth. The mar-\nriage clothes were sent home as the funeral bier was\npreparing, and a cloud of woe bedimmed the now\nblasted hopes of the partner of her bosom. The eldest\nson, prostrated on a bed of death, had just returned\nfrom a five years' study in the learned cloisters of old\nHarvard, crowned with bis laurel wreaths of honor\nand glory. Death spread his banner o'er the whole.\nFather, mother, son and daughter, now sleep the sleep\nof death, stretched side by side, and wrapped in the\nembraces of the cold earth.\nPainful Occurrence.-A tragical affair was witnessed\non Thursday which resulted in the death of Mr. Mel-\nzar Gardner, editor of the Portsmouth Chronicle and\nOld Dominion' in a recontre with Mordecai Cooke,\nJr. Esq. of this Borough.\nMr. Cooke was returning from Portsmouth in the\nferry boat; Mr. Gardner was on the wharf. As Mr.\nCooke stepped ashore, he was accosted by Mr. Gard-\nner, and they were in conversation for a few seconds,\nwhen Mr. C. was seen to raise a walking cane; but\nbefore any hostile demonstration could be made, Mr.\nGardner stepped back and drew a pistol from his coat\npocket, upon which Mr. Cooke seized hold on the\npistol, when a violent struggle ensued, when the pistol\nwent off and Gardner fell\u2014the charge in the pistol\nhaving passed through his body, and in less than\nfifteen minutes life was extinct.-Norfolk Herald.\nNegro Killed.-On Sunday night, near the rail-road,\na black man was shot by a Mr. Roland. The gun\nwas heavily charged, and its contents produced death\nalmost immediately. It appears that he was expected\non the premises, and Roland and a friend lay in wait\nfor him. In the eagerness of both to arrest ihe thief,\nthe latter discharged his gun by mistake into the side\nof Roland, who was also very severely wounded.\nThe body of the negro lay in the guard-house yes-\nterday for identification, and was found to belong to\na gentleman not a resident of the city.-- Mobile Tri-\nbune.\nHorrible.--We understand that a man by the name\nof Dick Stewart, living at Cypress Bend, in Arkan-\nsas, recently shot a poor wood-chopper, who came\nto his house for a night's slelter, and turned his dogs\nupon his carcass to devour it. His motive for this\nbrutal act was revenge for some other wood-choppers\nhaving stolen one of his negroes. A reward of $1000\nhas been offered for the apprehension of the murderer.\nThe intelligence of this horrid affair was brought to\nthe city yesterday, by steamboat Somerville. The\ndetails are too dreadful for rehearsal, and evince a de-\ngree of ferocity and barbarism almost beyond belief.\nN: Orleans Bee.\nEdrthquake in Montpelier.-On Tuesday night last,\nthe 14th inst. about 9 o'clock, P. M. a distant shock,\nor shaking of the earth, accompanied by a rumbling\nnoise; much like that of a heavy wagon passing over\nfrozen ground, was observed by many people in Mont-\npelier and vicinity. It seemed to come in an east-\nern direction.- Montpelier (Vt.) Watchman.\nAnother Hurder in the Penitentiary.--Two black\nwomen killed a white woman in prison, on Friday\nlast, by beating her brains out with the shovel and\ntongs. The reason they gave is, that they want to\nget out of the penitentiary into the county jail. They\nare likely to be deprived of that pleasure, however.\nColumbus (0.)

The Judge was shot in the right\narm with a double-barrel gun, so badly that amputa-\ntion was deemed necessary, and was performed. The\ncause of the difficulty we have not learned.\nMeteor.-A meteor of great size and intense bright-\nness, passed over this city yesterday morning between\n3 and 4 o'clock. It came from the South, and travel-\nled northward with prodigious velocity, perfectly illu-\nminating every part of the city during the time of its\ntransit. One of tlie watchmen decribes its size as be-\ning equal to that of a hogshead, though any estimate\nof it must be considered as very uncertain. The\nnight was very dark wlien the \u00e6rolite passed over.\nSad. Rep. March 28.\nWonderful Mine:--The Winchester Virginian con-\ntains an annunciation of the discovery of a mine about\neighteen miles southwest from that place, the ore of\nwhich is alleged to contain 'gold, silver, copper, and\nperhaps other minerals.' This wonderful mine, it is\nasserted, is as great in extent as it is rich in the pre-\ncious metals, being about twenty miles in length by six\nor eight in breadth.\nStatistics of Crimie. --The number of convictions in\nthe courts of record of the State of New York, in\n1842, was 1602--of the convicts, 1491 are males and\n111 females ; 609 are married, and 680 single ; 650\nhave been temperate, and 473 intemperate ; 880 were\nborn in the United States, 100 are colored, and two\nare Indians.\nThe number of convictions in the courts of Special\nSessions was 27417-313 less than in 1841.\nOregon is now the theme of general interest at the\nWest. Large meetings to discuss the policy of taking\nformal possession of and colonizing it, have been held\nat Columbus, Ohio, and several other places. Many\nare preparing to emigrate. A band of hardy settlers\nwill rendezvous at Fort Leavenworth, and set out\nthence for Oregon early in May, under the command\nof Maj. Fitzpatrick.\nSuicide from Millerism.-- George Florida, a black-\nsmith, formerly in the employ of C. Damon & Co.\nSpringfield, hung himself with an iron chain on Mon-\nday nigiit. He was found in the morning suspended\nby the chain, dead, with a Bible by his side, and a\ndagger in his pocket. He has been in a deranged\nstate of mind for some time, caused by imbibing the\ndoctrines of Millerism.- Boston Trans.\nA gentleman at Point Petre, Guadaloupe, states\nthat during the earthquake in that place, while at-\ntempting to escape, his foot and leg were caught in\none of the deep fissures of the earth, and he thought\nhe was fast. But another shock came, and the crack\nopened again, and he escaped !\nWe understand that in the case of Asa Child, vs.\nthe Norwich and Worcester Rail-road Company, the\nAuditors have decided that Mr. Child is indebted to\nthe Company cight thousand two hundred dollars. It\nwill be recollected that Mr. C. claimed the Company\nowed him $10,000.- Hartford Courant.\nWhy are washerwomen the greatest navigators of\nthe globe? Because they are continually crossing the\nline, and running from pole to pole. New Brighton Collegiate School,\n.\nNEW-BRIGHTON, STATEN ISLAND.\nGEO. L. LE ROW, A. M. Principal.\nWHIS Institution will be opened on the first\nStaten Island, six miles from New York, on the\nheights of New-Brighton, overlooking that beautiful\nvilla, and the harbor and city of New-York. There\nis a constant, and almost hourly communication be-\ntween New-Brighton and New-York, and the school\nis within three minutes walk of the landing of the\nsteamers.\nThe building is entirely new, beautifully finished,\nample and commodious for the limited number of pu-\npils; the playgrounds and gymnastic apparatus are\narranged after the models of the best European\nschools. These, combined with the facilities for sea-\nbathing, in the season, furnish excellent opportuni-\nties for the physical development of youth.\nThe Principal having had several year's experience\nin one of our first collegiate schools, and having,\nmore recently, personally examined the schools and\nstudied the discipline of the literary institutions of\nEurope, feels himself competent to the charge which\nhe has assumed. He has associated with himself\ncompetent and experienced teachers for all the\nbranches taught in a thorough classical and English\neducation.\nThe objects of the Principal are, to combine phys-\nical and moral with intellectual education, so as to en-\nsure to youth sound bodies with disciplined and pure\nminds, and to prepare pupils for all the ordinary pro-\nfessions of life, or for admission into our Colleges or\nUniversities.\nDISCIPLINE.\nThe discipline of the school will be strict and\nfirm, yet mild and parental; the pipils, associating\nwith the family, will be constantly under the super-\nvision of the Principal or his Teachers.\nThe approbation of teachers; of parents and friends,\nand a consciousness of integrity will, it is hoped, prove\nsufficient inducements to incite the pupil to the dis-\ncharge of his duty. Flogging will constitute no part\nof the discipline, and where other correctives fail to\nrestore a wayward pupil, his parents, gnardians,\nwill be requested to remove him, of in case of flagrant\nor continued violation of order, expulsion will fol-\nlow.\nThe peculiarities of no religious sect will be taught,\nbut the lessons of virtue and religion, and the moral\nrelations of man to his Creator, a\u0161 inculcated in the\nholy scriptures, will constitute a principle in the daily\ngovernment of the school. The pupils will attend\nDivine worship on Sundays, with the family of the\nPrincipal.\nApril 7.",
